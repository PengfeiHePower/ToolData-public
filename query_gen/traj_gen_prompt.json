Ensure that the query is **challenging and realistic**, involving rich and precise requirements (e.g., filtering, customization, geographic precision).\n3.

Your task is to:generate a complex, realistic tool-using plan (tool-calling trajectory) for the given domain and task. \n## Requirements\n\n1. The tools must be called **sequentially**, meaning each tool depends on the output of one or more previous tools.\n2. Use only tools from the provided tool list.\n3. Make the query complex and grounded in a realistic user scenario.\n4. Clearly explain how the output of one tool connects to the input of the next using placeholder notation like: {{listing_id from step 1}}.\n"
