Lastly, I need to test some probability scenarios - could you simulate rolling four standard dice three times, and also show me what happens when rolling two 20-sided dice three times?",
    "hard_rewrite": "I've been diving into gaming culture lately and wanted to explore what critics considered exceptional last year. I'm also trying to improve my chess skills - particularly those middlegame scenarios where having an advantage requires careful planning about 3 moves ahead at around the 1800 level. My friend just started playing Lost Ark and keeps asking me about all the different character options, those level 3 guardian challenges, and which islands might have the best rewards. I'm also helping my nephew complete his British Pok\u00e9mon collection. Oh, and for our tabletop night tomorrow, I need to test some probability scenarios with both regular dice and those special 20-sided ones - three trials each with four standard dice and then two of the specialty dice."
