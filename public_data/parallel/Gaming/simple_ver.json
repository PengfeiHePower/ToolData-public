    "final_answer": "I've gathered information to help with your decision between Rocket League and Lost Ark, but there are some limitations in what I could retrieve:\n\n**Rocket League Blog Information:**\nUnfortunately, the Rocket League Blog tool returned an empty result ({}). This means I couldn't retrieve any current news, updates, or events from the official Rocket League blog to inform your decision. This is a significant limitation as we don't have current information about the game's development or special events.\n\n**Lost Ark Level 3 Raids:**\nI was able to retrieve information about the Level 3 raids in Lost Ark that your friends are playing. There are four Level 3 guardian raids available:\n- Dark Legoros (Item Level requirement: 802)\n- Helgaia (Item Level requirement: 840)\n- Calventus (Item Level requirement: 880)\n- Achates (Item Level requirement: 920)\n\nThese raids are progressively more difficult, requiring higher item levels to participate. This gives you an idea of the content your friends might be engaging with.\n\n**Travis North Reviews:**\nWhen searching for Travis North, the closest match found was Travis Northup (with a similarity score of 0.25). The tool also returned other reviewers with similar names, but none that exactly match 'Travis North'. The top results were:\n1. Travis Northup (id: 481)\n2. Travis Bruno (id: 9157)\n3. Travis White (id: 5829)\n4. Travis Huber (id: 348)\n5. Travis Amores (id: 3578)\n\nHowever, the tool didn't provide any actual reviews from these authors about either game, just their profile information.\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the limited information gathered, I can only provide you with details about Lost Ark's Level 3 raids. I couldn't retrieve any current information about Rocket League or find specific reviews from Travis North (or Travis Northup) about either game. To make a fully informed decision, you might want to visit the official Rocket League website directly, check gaming review sites for Travis Northup's content, or perhaps ask your friends more about their Lost Ark experience with those specific raids.",

These numbers suggest a healthy player base across various game modes.\n\n## 2. Random Card Draw (Valorant vs Apex Legends)\nThe card draw returned **10 of Diamonds**. If you were using this as a decision mechanism between Valorant and Apex Legends, you now have your random result to help decide.\n\n## 3. Upcoming CSGO Tournaments\nUnfortunately, the tool did not return any information about upcoming CSGO tournaments. The API call was made but no data was returned in the output. This means I cannot provide you with information about competitive CSGO events this weekend.\n\n## 4.

The error message indicated: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\" I cannot provide you with the requested information about this game at this time.\n\n## 5.

This suggests the API expected different values than what was provided. I cannot provide information about current Rocket League challenges.\n\n## Summary\nBased on the available information, Rocket League has a substantial active player base (nearly 300,000 players online), which suggests it would be worth getting into if you enjoy that style of game.

The tool returned several other critics with similar names, but Travis Northup appears to be the most relevant match. \n\n*Note: The tool only provided basic identification information and not actual reviews from Travis Northup about Lost Ark.*\n\n## Digital Stores Selling the Game\nThe CheapShark API returned information about digital PC game stores, including:\n\n**Active Stores:**\n- Steam (storeID: 1)\n- GamersGate (storeID: 2)\n- GreenManGaming (storeID: 3)\n- GOG (storeID: 7)\n- Origin (storeID: 8)\n- Humble Store (storeID: 11)\n\n*Note: The tool output was cut off, so there may be additional active stores not shown in the results. Also, this tool only showed available stores, not specifically which ones sell Lost Ark or at what price.*\n\n## Dice Roll Result\nYour dice roll resulted in: [6, 3, 4, 6, 1]\nTotal: 20\n\nSince the total is exactly 20 (not over 20), according to your criteria, this doesn't quite reach the threshold for a definite purchase.\n\n## Summary\nLost Ark offers a diverse range of character classes catering to different playstyles, with endgame content that progressively increases in difficulty. While we identified Travis Northup as a potential critic you mentioned, we couldn't access his specific reviews of Lost Ark. The game appears to be available on several digital platforms, though specific availability and pricing information wasn't provided.

With the Ace of Spades being the highest card, this could be a sign to try the top game from either list.\n\n## UK Pok\u00e9dex Data for Character Creation Inspiration\n\nHere are the first few Pok\u00e9mon from the UK Pok\u00e9dex to inspire your character creation:\n\n1. **Bulbasaur** (#001)\n   - Type: Grass/Poison\n   - Ability: Overgrow\n   - Weaknesses: Fire, Psychic, Flying, Ice\n\n2. **Ivysaur** (#002)\n   - Type: Grass/Poison\n   - Ability: Overgrow\n   - Weaknesses: Fire, Psychic, Flying, Ice\n\n3. **Venusaur** (#003)\n   - Type: Grass/Poison\n   - Ability: Overgrow\n   - Weaknesses: Fire, Psychic, Flying, Ice\n\n4. **Charmander** (#004)\n   - Type: Fire\n   - Ability: Blaze\n   - Weaknesses: Water, Ground, Rock\n\n5. **Charmeleon** (#005)\n   - Type: Fire\n   - Ability: Blaze\n   - Weaknesses: Water, Ground, Rock\n\n6. **Charizard** (#006)\n   - Type: Fire/Flying\n   - Ability: Blaze\n   - Weaknesses: Water, Electric, Rock\n\n7. **Squirtle** (#007)\n   - Type: Water\n   - Ability: Torrent\n   - Weaknesses: Grass, Electric\n\n*Note: The Pok\u00e9dex data was cut off after Squirtle, so only the first 7 Pok\u00e9mon were provided.*\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your weekend gaming, you have several free-to-play MMORPGs with fantasy and PvP elements to choose from, with Guild Wars 2 and Neverwinter being particularly well-established options. If you're interested in games with \"God\" in the title, God of War stands out as the most recognized title. For Lost Ark, focus on the six main stats (Crit, Specialization, Domination, Swiftness, Endurance, and Expertise) based on your preferred playstyle. Your all-spades card draw suggests going with the highest-rated option, and you might draw inspiration for your character from the starter Pok\u00e9mon, particularly if you're drawn to elemental themes like fire, water, or grass/poison combinations.",

The data includes game IDs, prices, and thumbnail images but doesn't specify which stores are offering these deals.\n\n## 2) Top-Rated Games from 2022\nThe OpenCritic API returned Hall of Fame games from 2022, though the output was partially truncated. From what was returned:\n\n- **Elden Ring** (95/100): Released February 25, 2022\n  - Tier: Mighty\n  - Available on: PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, Xbox One, PS4\n\n- **God of War Ragnar\u00f6k** (92/100): Released November 9, 2022\n  - Tier: Mighty\n  - Available on: PS4 (and likely PS5, though the data was cut off)\n\n**Limitation**: The tool output was incomplete, so there are likely more top-rated games from 2022 that weren't included in this response.\n\n## 3) Latest Rocket League News\nUnfortunately, the Rocket League Blog tool returned an empty response ({}). No current news, events, or updates for Rocket League could be retrieved.\n\n## 4) Pikachu Information\nThe Pokedex tool provided detailed information about Pikachu:\n\n**Regular Pikachu**:\n- Height: 0.4 m\n- Weight: 6.0 kg\n- Category: Mouse Pok\u00e9mon\n- Type: Electric\n- Weaknesses: Ground\n- Ability: Static\n- Pok\u00e9dex ID: 25\n- Available as both male and female\n\n**Gigantamax Pikachu**:\n- Height: >21.0 m\n- Weight: ???.? kg\n- Same type, category, abilities, and weaknesses as regular Pikachu\n\nBoth forms include thumbnail images from the official Pok\u00e9mon website.\n\n## 5) Chess Puzzle\nThe Chess Puzzles tool was called with puzzle ID 'HxxIU', but unfortunately returned no data. A different puzzle ID might be needed, or the service might be experiencing issues.\n\n## 6) Game Critic Information\nThe OpenCritic API search for 'Travis North' returned several similar names, but no exact match. The closest match was:\n\n- **Travis Northup** (75% match)\n\nOther critics with similar names included Travis Bruno, Travis White, Travis Huber, and others, but none specifically named 'Travis North'.\n\n## Summary\nFor your gaming weekend, I've found several affordable Batman games on PC with prices ranging from $2.29 to $4.99. From 2022's top games, Elden Ring and God of War Ragnar\u00f6k stand out as highly-rated titles worth considering. I've provided detailed Pikachu information for your Pok\u00e9mon fan friend. Unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve any Rocket League news, a chess puzzle, or reviews from a critic named Travis North (though Travis Northup might be who you're thinking of). You may want to check the Rocket League official website directly for the latest updates and try a different chess puzzle resource.",

The tool returned an empty result ({}), so I can't provide you with information about any current special events in Rocket League.\n\n## 3) Lost Ark Engravings\nI found information about Lost Ark engravings for your friend.

I rolled 5 dice and got:\n- Die 1: 6\n- Die 2: 3\n- Die 3: 4\n- Die 4: 6\n- Die 5: 1\n\nTotal: 20\n\nYou can use this same tool during your gaming session to roll any number of dice as needed.\n\n## 6) Random Card Draw\nFor your drinking game, I drew a random card from a standard deck:\n\n**Ace of Clubs (A\u2663)**\n\n## Summary\nYour gaming night looks promising!

Unfortunately, I cannot provide any recent news or updates about Rocket League that might influence your decision to get back into it.\n\n## God of War Reviews\nThe OpenCritic API search returned several God of War related games:\n- God of War (main title)\n- God of War Ragnar\u00f6k\n- God of War III Remastered\n- God of Rock\n- God of Riffs\n\nHowever, the tool only provided search results with game IDs and names, not the actual critic reviews or ratings. To make an informed decision, you would need additional information about critics' opinions that wasn't returned by the tool.\n\n## Lost Ark Engravings\nThe Lost Ark API successfully returned a comprehensive list of 42 available engravings for character builds:\n\nKey engravings include combat-focused options like:\n- Grudge (increases damage but makes you more vulnerable)\n- Cursed Doll (increases attack power with healing reduction)\n- Keen Blunt Weapon (critical hit damage with accuracy penalty)\n- Adrenaline (attack power stacks)\n- Hit Master (damage increase for non-back/front attacks)\n\nAnd utility engravings like:\n- Spirit Absorption (movement/attack speed)\n- Heavy Armor (defense)\n- Awakening (ultimate skill cooldown)\n- Expert (healing/shielding effectiveness)\n\nThis information should help you plan your character build effectively.\n\n## D&D Dice Roll Simulation\nThe Dice Roll Simulator successfully rolled 4d20 dice for your campaign setup:\n- Individual rolls: [3, 1, 14, 8]\n- Total: 26\n\nThese results can be used for your D&D session planning.\n\n## CS:GO Matches\nThe CS:GO matches tool returned information about recent matches, but the data appears to be truncated. From what was returned, I can see:\n\n1. Sharks defeated RED Canids 1-0 in a best-of-1 match at ESL Challenger League Season 49 South America (played online on April 8, 2025)\n2. RED Canids defeated Sharks in another match (details partially cut off)\n\nNote that the data appears to be from future dates (2025), which suggests this may be test data rather than actual recent matches. The output was also cut off, limiting the complete information about your favorite teams' performance.\n\n## Hearthstone Card: A Light in the Darkness\nThe Hearthstone API successfully returned detailed information about the card:\n\n- Name: A Light in the Darkness\n- Type: Spell (Holy school)\n- Class: Paladin\n- Mana Cost: 2\n- Rarity: Common\n- Effect: \"Discover a minion. Give it +1/+1.\"\n- Set: Whispers of the Old Gods\n- Flavor Text: \"Wait, how can you have a light in the dark? If you turn on a light while it's dark, doesn't that mean it's no longer dark?\"\n\nThis card allows you to discover a minion and buff it slightly, which could be useful for your collection deck.\n\n## Summary\nI've provided information on Lost Ark engravings for your character build, simulated dice rolls for your D&D session, and details about the Hearthstone card you were interested in. Unfortunately, I couldn't provide Rocket League updates due to an empty API response, the God of War search only returned game titles without reviews, and the CS:GO match data was incomplete and possibly not current.

There's also this particular chess position with the reference 'HxxIU' that my friend recommended. For my Lost Ark character build, I need to see all possible character enhancements available in the game. For my tabletop session tonight, I need to simulate a single cube toss, and then see what happens when four cubes are rolled simultaneously. By the way, I've been reading gaming journalism by someone with a name like 'Travis North' - can you help me find out more about this writer's work in the gaming industry?"

Current Free Game Giveaways on Steam\nThe GamerPower tool was executed to retrieve free game giveaways on Steam sorted by popularity, but unfortunately no results were returned. This could be due to an API error or there might not be any active giveaways at the moment.\n\n## 2. Lost Ark Guardian Raids for Level 3 Players\nThe Lost Ark raids tool provided the following Level 3 guardian raids:\n- Dark Legoros (Item Level: 802)\n- Helgaia (Item Level: 840)\n- Calventus (Item Level: 880)\n- Achates (Item Level: 920)\n\nThese raids are arranged in ascending order of difficulty based on the required item level.\n\n## 3. Complete List of Lost Ark Raids\nThe tool returned a comprehensive list of all guardian raids in Lost Ark, organized by raid level:\n\n**Level 1 Raids:**\n- Ur'nil (Item Level: 302)\n- Lumerus (Item Level: 340)\n- Icy Legoros (Item Level: 380)\n- Vertus (Item Level: 420)\n\n**Level 2 Raids:**\n- Chromanius (Item Level: 460)\n- Nacrasena (Item Level: 500)\n- Flame Fox Yoho (Item Level: 540)\n- Tytalos (Item Level: 580)\n\n**Level 3 Raids:**\n- Dark Legoros (Item Level: 802)\n- Helgaia (Item Level: 840)\n- Calventus (Item Level: 880)\n- Achates (Item Level: 920)\n\n**Level 4 Raids:**\n- Frost Helgaia (Item Level: 960)\n- Lava Chromanium (Item Level: 1000)\n- Levanos (Item Level: 1040)\n- Alberhastic (Item Level: 1080)\n\n**Level 5 Raids:**\n- Armored Nacrasena (Item Level: 1302)\n- Igrexion (Item Level: 1340)\n- Night Fox Yoho (Item Level: 1370)\n- Velganos (Item Level: 1385)\n\n## 4. Lost Ark Islands with Dropped Items\nThe tool returned information about islands with dropped items, but the data appears to be limited. The islands are not properly named (all listed as \"island\") and the output was cut off, indicating the response was incomplete. Each island has various item IDs associated with it, but without item names, this information has limited usefulness for treasure hunting.\n\n## 5. Azumarill in Pokemon Unite\nThe tool provided detailed information about Azumarill in Pokemon Unite:\n\n**Basic Information:**\n- Tier: B (Recently downgraded)\n- Range: Melee\n- Difficulty: Novice\n- Role: All-Rounder\n- Damage Type: Physical\n\n**Special Note:** All of Marill and Azumarill's attacks and damaging moves can critically strike, but the damage is 150% instead of 200%.\n\n**Recommended Builds:**\n1. **Aqua Pulse Build:**\n   - Lane: Center Share / Path Damage\n   - Held Items: Attack Weight, Focus Band, Weakness Policy\n   - Battle Items: X Speed (Optional: Full Heal)\n   - Basic Moves: Bubble, Tackle\n   - Upgrade Path: Aqua Tail, Water Pulse\n\n2. **Whirl Pulse Build:**\n   - Lane: Center Share / Path Damage\n   - Held Items: Attack Weight, Focus Band, Weakness Policy\n   - Battle Items: X Speed (Optional: Full Heal)\n   - Basic Moves: Bubble, Tackle\n   - Upgrade Path: Whirlpool, Water Pulse\n\n**Passive Ability:** Huge Power - When hitting only a single enemy, attacks are always critical hits. When hitting multiple enemies, attacks never critically hit.\n\n## 6. Current Rocket League Challenges\nThe Rocket League Challenges tool was executed to retrieve weekly challenges, but returned an empty result ({}).

    "final_answer": "# Gaming Weekend Planning Help\n\nI've gathered information to help with your gaming weekend decisions. Let me break down what I found for each of your requests:\n\n## 1) The Witcher 3 Reviews\nThe OpenCritic API search returned several Witcher-related games, with \"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\" being the closest match to your query. Unfortunately, the tool only provided game titles and match scores, not actual reviews or ratings. The game has ID 463 in their system, but we don't have review content to share.\n\n## 2) Upcoming CS:GO Tournaments\nThe CS:GO matches and tournaments tool did not return any data. This could be due to an API error or there might not be any upcoming tournaments in the database at this time.\n\n## 3) Pok\u00e9mon Available in Pok\u00e9mon Unite\nThe tool only returned information for a single Pok\u00e9mon (Pikachu) rather than a complete list. From this data, we can see that Pikachu is:\n- Tier: C (recently moved up)\n- Type: Ranged Attacker with Novice difficulty\n- Damage Type: Special\n- Has two recommended builds: \"Electro Tackle\" and \"Full Thunder\"\n\nHowever, this is only one Pok\u00e9mon and not the complete roster you requested.\n\n## 4) Lost Ark Character Stats\nThe Lost Ark stats tool returned the six main character stats in the game:\n- Crit\n- Specialization\n- Domination\n- Swiftness\n- Endurance\n- Expertise\n\nThis is a basic list of the stat categories but doesn't include detailed information about what each stat does or optimal builds.\n\n## 5) Hearthstone Cards\nThe Hearthstone cards tool did not return any data. This could be due to an API error or connection issue.\n\n## 6) Complete Pok\u00e9dex\nThe Pok\u00e9dex tool returned information for the first several Pok\u00e9mon, but the data appears to be cut off. We only received data for Pok\u00e9mon #001-007 (partial), which includes:\n- Bulbasaur (#001)\n- Ivysaur (#002)\n- Venusaur (#003)\n- Charmander (#004)\n- Charmeleon (#005)\n- Charizard (#006)\n- Squirtle (#007) - partial information\n\nThis is only the beginning of the Pok\u00e9dex and not the complete reference you requested.\n\n## 7) Valorant Weapon Information\nThe Valorant Weapons tool returned an error (HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error) when attempting to retrieve information about rifles. No weapon data is available.\n\n## 8) Dice Roll for Decision Making\nGood news! The dice roll simulator successfully rolled four 10-sided dice with the following results:\n- Dice values: 7, 9, 8, 7\n- Total: 31\n\nSince your criteria was to buy The Witcher 3 if the total roll was above 20, and the roll was 31, it looks like you should purchase The Witcher 3!\n\n## Summary\nWhile several tools returned limited or no information, we did get your dice roll result of 31, which exceeds your threshold of 20 for purchasing The Witcher 3. Based on this result, you should add The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to your gaming weekend plans!",

Free Steam Giveaways\nI attempted to retrieve free Steam giveaways sorted by popularity using the GamerPower tool, but unfortunately, the tool did not return any results. This might be due to an error or no current giveaways matching your criteria.\n\n## 2. Upcoming CS:GO Matches\nI tried to check upcoming CS:GO matches for this weekend using the CSGO matches tool, but it didn't return any data. This could be due to an API limitation or no scheduled matches in the database.\n\n## 3. Lost Ark Guardian Raids (Level 3)\nThe Lost Ark raids tool successfully returned information about level 3 guardian raids:\n\n| Guardian Name | Item Level Required |\n|---------------|--------------------|\n| Dark Legoros  | 802                |\n| Helgaia       | 840                |\n| Calventus     | 880                |\n| Achates       | 920                |\n\n## 4. Active Digital Game Stores\nThe CheapShark tool provided information about digital game stores for price comparison. Here are the currently active stores:\n\n- Steam (ID: 1)\n- GamersGate (ID: 2)\n- GreenManGaming (ID: 3)\n- GOG (ID: 7)\n- Origin (ID: 8)\n- Humble Store (ID: 11)\n\n**Note:** The tool returned additional stores, but the output was truncated. Some inactive stores identified include Amazon (ID: 4), GameStop (ID: 5), Direct2Drive (ID: 6), Get Games (ID: 9), Shiny Loot (ID: 10), and Desura (ID: 12).\n\n## 5. Last Played CS:GO Matches\nI attempted to retrieve your last played CS:GO matches, but the tool didn't return any data. This might require authentication or there may be no recent match history available.\n\n## 6. Random Card Draw\nThe Card Draw Simulator successfully drew a random card for your gaming night drinking game:\n\n**Drawn Card: 10 of Diamonds (10\u2666)**\n\n## 7. Pok\u00e9mon Unite Characters\nI tried to retrieve a list of Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Unite, but the tool didn't return any data. This could be due to an API limitation or connection issue.\n\n## 8. Lost Ark Islands with Dropped Items\nThe Lost Ark islands tool returned information about islands with dropped items, but the data was incomplete (truncated). The tool showed multiple islands, each with various items identified by numeric IDs. For example:\n- First island drops items: 133003, 510103, 889005, 889101\n- Second island drops items: 201201, 403003, 889102, 6830302\n\nUnfortunately, the item names were not provided, only their IDs, and the island names were all generically labeled as 'island' rather than their actual names.\n\n## 9. Lost Ark Character Stats\nThe Lost Ark stats tool successfully returned the main character stats in Lost Ark:\n\n- Crit\n- Specialization\n- Domination\n- Swiftness\n- Endurance\n- Expertise\n\n## Summary\nI've gathered partial information for your gaming weekend. While I was able to provide details on Lost Ark guardian raids, active digital game stores, a random card draw, and Lost Ark character stats, several tools returned incomplete data or no results at all.

Pok\u00e9mon Option - Charizard Details\n\nThe Pok\u00e9dex tool provided comprehensive information about Charizard:\n\n### Base Charizard:\n- Height: 1.7 m\n- Weight: 90.5 kg\n- Type: Fire/Flying\n- Weaknesses: Water, Electric, Rock\n- Ability: Blaze\n\nThe tool also returned information about Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Gigantamax Charizard forms, each with their own unique characteristics.\n\n### Charizard in Pok\u00e9mon Unite:\n- Tier: D (with a downward trend)\n- Role: All-Rounder\n- Range: Melee\n- Difficulty: Novice\n- Damage Type: Physical\n- Evolution Path: Charmander (Level 5) \u2192 Charmeleon (Level 9) \u2192 Charizard\n\nThe tool provided three different builds for Charizard in Unite:\n1. Flame Blitz (Path Damage)\n2. Flame Blast (Center Damage)\n3. Fire Blitz (Path Damage)\n\n**Note:** The Pok\u00e9mon Unite data appears to be truncated, as the skills section was cut off, so we don't have complete information about all of Charizard's abilities.\n\n## 2. Tabletop RPG Dice Rolls\n\nHere are the results from our dice roll simulations:\n\n- Single six-sided die: **3**\n- Three six-sided dice: **[6, 5, 1]** with a total of **12**\n- Twenty-sided die: **8**\n- Two rolls of 4 dice each:\n  - First roll: [4, 2, 6, 1] = 13\n  - Second roll: [6, 4, 1, 3] = 14\n  - Total across both rolls: 27\n\nThese dice roll results can give you a feel for the randomness involved in tabletop RPGs.\n\n## 3. Lost Ark Information\n\n### Available Classes:\n- **Warrior**: Berserker, Paladin, Gunlancer\n- **Martial Artist**: Striker, Wardancer, Scrapper, Soulfist\n- **Gunner**: Gunslinger, Artillerist, Deadeye, Sharpshooter\n- **Mage**: Bard, Sorceress\n- **Assassin**: Shadowhunter, Deathblade\n\n### Level 1 Raids:\n1. Ur'nil (Item Level 302)\n2. Lumerus (Item Level 340)\n3. Icy Legoros (Item Level 380)\n4. Vertus (Item Level 420)\n\n## 4. Gaming Giveaways and Deals\n\nUnfortunately, the GamerPower tool for Steam giveaways returned no results. This could mean there are currently no active giveaways that match your criteria, or there might have been an issue with the tool.\n\nRegarding digital PC game stores for deals, the query didn't return specific information about stores to check. However, popular options typically include Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG, Humble Bundle, Green Man Gaming, and Fanatical.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your gaming night:\n\n- **Pok\u00e9mon Option**: Charizard is a Fire/Flying type with the Blaze ability. In Pok\u00e9mon Unite, it's a Tier D All-Rounder that evolves from Charmander and Charmeleon, with multiple build options despite being rated lower in the current meta.\n\n- **Tabletop RPG**: We've simulated various dice rolls that you might need for your game, showing the kind of randomness you can expect in gameplay.\n\n- **Lost Ark**: The game offers 5 main classes with multiple subclasses, giving players variety in playstyles. For beginners, there are 4 Level 1 raids available, starting at item level 302 and going up to 420.\n\nUnfortunately, we couldn't find current Steam giveaways to supplement your gaming night. Based on the information gathered, your choice depends on whether your group prefers action-based gameplay (Lost Ark), strategic team battles (Pok\u00e9mon Unite), or collaborative storytelling with dice rolls (tabletop RPG).",

Steam Loot Giveaways\nThe tool call for Steam loot giveaways sorted by popularity returned no data. This could be due to an API limitation or temporary unavailability.\n\n## 3. Rocket League News\nThe Rocket League News tool returned an empty response ({}), indicating that either there are no current news articles available or there was an issue with the API connection.\n\n## 4. Virtual Poker Setup\nI've drawn 20 cards from a standard deck that you can use for your 4 players (5 cards each):\n\nPlayer 1: 4\u2665, K\u2663, Q\u2666, J\u2665, 9\u2665\nPlayer 2: 8\u2663, 6\u2660, 10\u2666, J\u2660, 5\u2663\nPlayer 3: 10\u2663, A\u2665, K\u2666, 3\u2665, 9\u2663\nPlayer 4: A\u2663, 8\u2666, 7\u2663, 6\u2663, 4\u2660\n\n## 5. Lost Ark Islands with Dropped Items\nI've retrieved information about islands with dropped items for your farming session. Note that the data appears to be truncated, as the output was cut off. Here's what was available:\n\nThe tool returned information for 20 islands, each with various items identified by numeric IDs. For example:\n- First island drops items with IDs: 133003, 510103, 889005, 889101\n- Second island drops items with IDs: 201201, 403003, 889102, 6830302\n\n**Limitation**: The island names appear to be generic ('island') rather than their actual names, and the item IDs are not translated to item names, making this information less useful without additional context.\n\n## 6. Pokemon Unite Characters\nThe Pokemon Unite characters list tool returned no data. This could be due to an API limitation or temporary unavailability.\n\n## 7. D&D Dice Rolls\nFor your D&D side game, I rolled 3d8 with the following results:\n- Die 1: 6\n- Die 2: 3\n- Die 3: 4\n- **Total**: 13\n\n## 8. Lost Ark Item Details\nI found information about the 'Hollowfruit' item you're trying to craft:\n\n- **ID**: 70500059\n- **Name**: Hollowfruit\n- **Sell Status**: Unsellable\n- **Disassembly**: Can be disassembled\n- **Max Stack**: 999\n- **Tier**: Not specified\n- **Grade**: 3\n- **Durability**: Indestructible\n- **Description**: \"An item used to increase Rapport with NPCs. The fruit of the Potenkul tree indigenous to Punika and the Rimeria continent. It looks luscious at first, but it's actually hollow on the inside.\"\n\n## 9. Rocket League Blog Updates\nThe Rocket League Blog tool returned an empty response ({}), indicating that either there are no current blog updates available or there was an issue with the API connection.\n\n## 10. Gaming Giveaways by Value\nThe tool call for gaming giveaways sorted by value returned no data. This could be due to an API limitation or temporary unavailability.\n\n## Summary\nI've gathered information for your gaming weekend, though several tools returned incomplete or no data. You have a complete list of Lost Ark abyssal dungeons, a virtual poker setup for 4 players, dice rolls for your D&D game, and details about the Hollowfruit item in Lost Ark. Unfortunately, the information about Lost Ark islands was limited to item IDs without names, and several other tools (Steam giveaways, Pokemon Unite characters, Rocket League news/blog, and gaming giveaways) returned no data.

Has that car soccer game's official site mentioned anything new lately? And finally, which gaming giveaways currently offer the most bang for zero bucks?"

    "final_answer": "# Gaming Decision Analysis Based on Multiple Data Sources\n\n## 1. 2023 Hall of Fame Games\nThe OpenCritic API returned information about critically acclaimed games from 2023. The top titles include:\n\n- **Baldur's Gate 3** (Score: 96) - A \"Mighty\" tier game released in August 2023 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S\n- **The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom** (Score: 95) - A \"Mighty\" tier Nintendo Switch exclusive released in May 2023\n- **Videoverse** - Another \"Mighty\" tier game, though the data was cut off in the API response\n\nNote: The API response was truncated, so there are likely more Hall of Fame games not shown here.\n\n## 2. Free-to-Play MMORPGs with PVP for PC\nThe Free-to-Play Games Database returned several options:\n\n- **Blade and Soul** (2016) - Martial arts MMORPG with combination attacks\n- **Trove** (2015) - Sandbox MMORPG\n- **ArcheAge** (2014) - Hybrid fantasy/sandbox MMORPG\n- **Neverwinter** (2013) - D&D-based action MMORPG\n- **Guild Wars 2** - Popular MMORPG follow-up to Guild Wars\n\nNote: The API response was truncated, so there are likely more games matching these criteria.\n\n## 3. Rocket League Community and Player Counts\nThe Rocket League News API returned an empty response ({}), so no community news is available.\n\nHowever, the Population API successfully returned current player counts:\n- **Total online players**: 297,649\n- **Most popular modes**:\n  - Doubles (Ranked): 45,591 players\n  - Standard (Ranked): 30,900 players\n  - Doubles: 26,083 players\n  - Standard: 22,917 players\n- **Least popular modes**:\n  - Snow Day: 1,555 players\n  - Dropshot: 1,931 players\n\n## 4. Upcoming CSGO Matches\nThe CSGO matches API did not return any data, so I cannot provide information about upcoming matches for your viewing schedule.\n\n## 5. Azumarill Stats in Pokemon Unite\nThe Pokemon Unite API returned detailed information about Azumarill:\n\n- **Tier**: B (recently downgraded)\n- **Role**: All-Rounder (Melee, Novice difficulty)\n- **Damage Type**: Physical\n- **Special Ability**: Huge Power - Guarantees critical hits when hitting single enemies, but never crits when hitting multiple enemies\n- **Notable builds**:\n  1. Aqua Pulse build (Center Share/Path Damage)\n  2. Whirl Pulse build (Center Share/Path Damage)\n- **Recommended items**: Attack Weight, Focus Band, Weakness Policy with X Speed battle item\n\nNote: The API response was truncated, so some skill details may be missing.\n\n## 6. Chess Puzzle\nThe Chess Puzzles API did not return any data for puzzle ID: HxxIU.\n\n## 7. Lost Ark Level 1 Raids\nThe Lost Ark API returned information about Level 1 Guardian Raids:\n\n- **Ur'nil**: Item Level 302\n- **Lumerus**: Item Level 340\n- **Icy Legoros**: Item Level 380\n- **Vertus**: Item Level 420\n\nThese are entry-level raids that would be suitable for beginners or players with lower gear scores.\n\n## 8. Random Card Draw\nThe Card Draw Simulator returned: **Ace of Spades (A\u2660)**\n\n## 9. Valorant Weapon Creation\nThe Valorant Weapons API returned an error (HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error) when attempting to create a weapon in the \"testclass\" category. This suggests that either the \"testclass\" category doesn't exist or there was a server-side issue.\n\n## Recommendation Based on Available Data\n\nBased on the information gathered:\n\n1. If you're looking for a critically acclaimed single-player experience, **Baldur's Gate 3** or **The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom** would be excellent choices.\n\n2. For free MMORPG with PVP, **Guild Wars 2** has the strongest reputation among the options returned.\n\n3. **Rocket League** has a healthy player base (nearly 300,000 players online), with Ranked Doubles being the most popular mode.\n\n4. For Lost Ark, the Level 1 raids starting with Ur'nil (Item Level 302) would be appropriate for newer players.\n\n5. If you're interested in Pokemon Unite, Azumarill is currently a B-tier All-Rounder with unique critical hit mechanics.\n\nSince your card draw was the Ace of Spades, which traditionally represents new beginnings or mastery, perhaps focus on either starting Baldur's Gate 3 (the highest-rated game) or mastering one of the Lost Ark raids.",

The tool that was called ('CSGO matches and tournaments: Played') appears to be designed to retrieve a user's personal match history rather than professional tournament schedules. No data was returned from this tool, so I cannot provide information about which professional teams are playing this weekend.\n\n## PC Game Store Comparison\nThe CheapShark Game Deals tool provided a list of digital PC game stores where you can compare prices. Here are the currently active stores according to the data:\n\n- Steam (storeID: 1)\n- GamersGate (storeID: 2)\n- GreenManGaming (storeID: 3)\n- GOG (storeID: 7)\n- Origin (storeID: 8)\n- Humble Store (storeID: 11)\n\nNote that some stores like Amazon, GameStop, Direct2Drive, Get Games, Shiny Loot, and Desura are listed as inactive (isActive: 0).\n\n**Limitation:** The tool output appears to be truncated, as it cuts off after listing several stores. There may be additional active stores not shown in the results.\n\n## Lost Ark Engraving System\nThe Lost Ark tool returned a list of all available engravings in the game. These engravings are crucial for character builds as they provide various buffs and effects. Here's the complete list of engravings available:\n\nDisrespect, Spirit Absorption, Ether Enhancement, Stabilized Status, Grudge, Super Charge, Strong Will, Drops of Ether, Crisis Evasion, Keen Blunt Weapon, Vital Point Strike, Increased Max MP, MP Regen, Master of Escape, Fortitude, Crushing Fist, Shield Piercing, Masters's Tenacity, Divine Protection, Heavy Armor, Explosive Expert, Enhanced Shield, Necromancy, Preemptive Strike, Broken Bone, Lightning Fury, Cursed Doll, Contender, Master of Ambush, Magick Stream, Barricade, Raid Captain, Awakening, Master Brawler, Mass Increase, Propulsion, Hit Master, Adrenaline, All-out Attack, Expert, Emergency Rescue, Precision Dagger\n\n**Limitation:** While the tool provided a comprehensive list of engravings, it did not include details about what each engraving does, their effects, or how to optimize them for specific character builds.\n\n## Poker Card Simulation\nThe Card Draw Simulator successfully drew 7 random cards from a standard deck for your Friday night poker game. Here are the cards drawn:\n\n- 10 of Hearts (10\u2665)\n- King of Spades (K\u2660)\n- 10 of Diamonds (10\u2666)\n- 6 of Hearts (6\u2665)\n- 4 of Diamonds (4\u2666)\n- 3 of Diamonds (3\u2666)\n- 4 of Clubs (4\u2663)\n\nThis hand contains a pair of 10s and a pair of 4s, giving you Two Pair in poker terminology.\n\n## Summary\nI've gathered information about PC game stores for price comparison, Lost Ark's engraving system, and simulated a poker hand for your Friday night game.

After working through a good number of those, maybe I could try a handful of more challenging positions in the same area - something that would really push my calculation skills to the next level."

Rocket League Trivia\n\nThe Trivia tool returned an error message indicating that the 'limit' parameter is only available for premium subscribers. I wasn't able to retrieve any Rocket League or gaming trivia through this tool. For your watch party, I suggest checking fan sites like Reddit's r/RocketLeague or the official Rocket League website for interesting facts about teams, players, or the game's history.\n\n## 3. Free Game Giveaways\n\nThe GamerPower tool was queried for PC game giveaways sorted by date, but unfortunately, it didn't return any results. This could mean either there were no active giveaways at the time of the query, or there was an issue with the tool's connection. I recommend checking websites like GamerPower.com, r/FreeGameFindings on Reddit, or following esports organizations on social media for potential giveaways during the tournament weekend.\n\n## 4. Epic Games Store Free Games\n\nThe Epic Games Store tool returned information about a currently free game called \"Outliver: Tribulation,\" which is described as an \"African Mythology meets Survival-Horror and Souls-like\" experience. However, the output was cut off, so I couldn't see the complete details including the end date of this offer or if there are any other free games available. The game doesn't appear to be directly related to esports.\n\nNote that the output was incomplete, so there might be additional free games not shown in the results.\n\n## 5. Dice-Rolling Game Setup\n\nThe Dice Roll Simulator successfully rolled a six-sided die, resulting in a 3. You can use this tool to create a simple prediction game during tournament breaks. Here's a suggestion:\n\n- Roll a die for each team in the upcoming match\n- Even numbers = win, odd numbers = loss\n- Players can bet on which team will win based on the dice roll\n- Or create your own system where different numbers represent different match outcomes (blowout win, close game, overtime, etc.)\n\nThe dice roll simulator works well and could add a fun interactive element to your watch party during breaks in the tournament action.",

However, when hitting multiple enemies simultaneously, the hits never critically strike.\n- **Note**: Azumarill's critical hits deal 150% damage instead of the standard 200%.\n\n### Recommended Builds\n\n1. **Aqua Pulse Build**\n   - **Lane**: Center Share / Path Damage\n   - **Held Items**: Attack Weight, Focus Band, Weakness Policy\n   - **Battle Items**: X Speed (Optional: Full Heal)\n   - **Basic Moves**: Bubble, Tackle\n   - **Upgrade Path**: Aqua Tail, Water Pulse\n\n2. **Whirl Pulse Build**\n   - **Lane**: Center Share / Path Damage\n   - **Held Items**: Attack Weight, Focus Band, Weakness Policy\n   - **Battle Items**: X Speed (Optional: Full Heal)\n   - **Basic Moves**: Bubble, Tackle\n   - **Upgrade Path**: Whirlpool, Water Pulse\n\n**Limitation**: The tool response was cut off, so there may be additional skills, moves, or information about Azumarill that wasn't provided.\n\n## Lost Ark: Core Character Stats Overview\n\nThe Lost Ark database provided a list of the core character stats in the game:\n\n- **Crit**: Affects critical hit chance\n- **Specialization**: Class-specific stat that enhances certain abilities\n- **Domination**: Increases damage against staggered or controlled enemies\n- **Swiftness**: Improves attack/movement speed and cooldown reduction\n- **Endurance**: Enhances defensive capabilities\n- **Expertise**: Improves status effect application and control\n\n**Limitation**: The tool only provided the names of the stats without detailed descriptions of their effects or how they scale, which would be valuable for new commentators.\n\n## OpenCritic Profile: Travis North\n\nThe OpenCritic search returned several potential matches for \"Travis North\":\n\n- The closest match is **Travis Northup** (ID: 481, similarity score: 0.25)\n- Other partial matches include Travis Bruno, Travis White, Travis Huber, and others\n\n**Limitation**: The search did not find an exact match for \"Travis North.\" The tool only returned names and IDs without detailed profile information. The closest match appears to be Travis Northup, but we cannot confirm if this is the analyst you're referring to without additional information.\n",

This could mean either there are no tournaments currently scheduled, the API didn't return any data, or there might be an issue with the service.\n\n## Lost Ark Character Stats\nThe Lost Ark stats tool provided the following core character statistics that are important for your team's strategy session:\n- Crit\n- Specialization\n- Domination\n- Swiftness\n- Endurance\n- Expertise\n\nThese are the main stats that affect your character's performance in Lost Ark. You can use this information to optimize your team's builds.\n\n## Hearthstone Card: Yogg-Saron, Hope's End\nThe Hearthstone card lookup returned detailed information about \"Yogg-Saron, Hope's End\":\n- Mana Cost: 10\n- Attack: 7\n- Health: 5\n- Type: Minion (Neutral)\n- Rarity: Legendary\n- Text: \"**Battlecry:** Cast a random spell for each spell you've cast this game *(targets chosen randomly)*.\"\n- Flavor Text: \"I spell your doom... Y-O-U-R D-O-O-M!\"\n- Set: Whispers of the Old Gods\n\nNote: The card description appears to be truncated in the tool output, so there might be additional details not shown here.\n\n## D&D Dice Roll Results\nI rolled 4 twenty-sided dice for your D&D pre-game, with the following results:\n- Die 1: 3\n- Die 2: 1\n- Die 3: 14\n- Die 4: 8\n- Total: 26\n\n## Chess Puzzle\nI attempted to look up the chess puzzle with ID 'HxxIU', but the tool didn't return any data. The puzzle might not exist with that ID, or there could be an issue with the chess puzzle database.\n\n## Lost Ark Island Drops\nThe tool returned information about items that drop on various Lost Ark islands. The data shows multiple islands (all named generically as \"island\" in the output) with different item drops identified by item IDs. For example:\n- First island drops items with IDs: 133003, 510103, 889005, 889101\n- Second island drops items with IDs: 201201, 403003, 889102, 6830302\n\nThe output includes data for at least 20 islands, but the item names aren't provided, only their IDs and quantities. This makes it difficult to plan your farming route without a way to translate these IDs to actual item names.\n\nNote: The island data appears to be truncated in the tool output, so there might be additional islands not shown here.\n\n## Summary\nI've gathered information on Lost Ark character stats and island drops (though only item IDs are available), details on the Hearthstone card Yogg-Saron, and rolled your D&D dice with results totaling 26.

Let me break down what I found:\n\n## 1. Player Information\n\nUnfortunately, the OpenCritic API search for 'Hearthstone championship FirebatHS Thijs' didn't return specific information about these players. It only returned related Hearthstone games and other championship titles. To get accurate player profiles, you might need to check official Hearthstone esports websites or player social media accounts.\n\n## 2. Popular Hearthstone Cards\n\nI attempted to retrieve information about the card 'Ziliax' using the Hearthstone Card API, but received a 'Not Found' error. This suggests either the card name was misspelled or the API has limited coverage. For accurate deck information, you might want to check sites like HearthPwn or the official Hearthstone website for current meta decks that these players might use.\n\n## 3. Gaming Giveaways\n\nThe GamerPower tool was called to find PC gaming giveaways sorted by date, but it returned no results. This could mean there were no active giveaways at the time of the query, or there was an issue with the API connection.\n\n## 4. Gaming Trivia\n\nThe Trivia API returned an error message indicating that the 'limit' parameter is only available for premium subscribers. Unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve gaming trivia for your watch party.\n\n## 5. Lost Ark Events\n\nThe Lost Ark API successfully returned information about abyssal dungeons in the game. Here's what's available:\n\n- **Ancient Elveria**: Demon Beast Canyon (iLvl 340), Necromancer's Origin (iLvl 340)\n- **Phantom Palace**: Hall of the Twisted Warlord (iLvl 460), Hildebrandt Palace (iLvl 460)\n- **Ark of Arrogance**: Road of Lament (iLvl 840), Forge of Fallen Pride (iLvl 840)\n- **Gate of Paradise**: Sea of Indolence (iLvl 960), Tranquil Karkosa (iLvl 960), Alaric's Sanctuary (iLvl 960)\n- **Oreha's Well**: Alirta's Oculus (iLvl 1325), Oreha Preveza (iLvl 1325)\n\nHowever, this is just general game content rather than specific events happening during the tournament weekend.\n\n## 6. Card Draw Simulation\n\nI successfully simulated 10 card draws from a standard deck. Your draws were:\n5\u2663, 4\u2660, 8\u2666, K\u2665, 6\u2663, 6\u2665, 5\u2666, 10\u2660, 10\u2663, 9\u2665\n\nYou can use this to practice probability calculations or card counting strategies, though this is for a standard playing card deck rather than Hearthstone cards.\n\n## 7. Other Competitive Card Games\n\nThe OpenCritic search for 'competitive card games' returned several options you might enjoy:\n\n- The Dresden Files: Cooperative Card Game\n- Card Detective\n- Card Game Bundle Vol. 1\n- KARDS - The WWII Card Game\n\nNote that the search results appear to include some non-card games as well, so you may want to research these titles further.\n\n## Summary\n\nI was able to provide some information about Lost Ark dungeons, simulate card draws, and suggest other card games, but unfortunately couldn't find specific details about the players, their potential decks, gaming giveaways, or trivia for your watch party. For more comprehensive preparation, I'd recommend checking official Hearthstone esports websites and community forums dedicated to competitive Hearthstone.",

Pokemon Unite Stats for Azumarill**\nThe Pokemon Unite tool provided detailed information about Azumarill:\n- Tier: B (Recently downgraded)\n- Role: All-Rounder with Melee range and Novice difficulty\n- Damage Type: Physical\n- Evolution: Evolves from Marill at level 4\n- Special Ability: \"Huge Power\" - Guarantees critical hits when hitting only a single enemy (at 150% damage instead of 200%), but never critical hits when hitting multiple enemies\n- Recommended Builds:\n  * \"Aqua Pulse\" build: Attack Weight, Focus Band, Weakness Policy with X Speed battle item\n  * \"Whirl Pulse\" build: Same held items but different move combinations\n- Last Updated: January 13, 2023\n\nNote: The tool output was cut off mid-response, so there may be additional information about Azumarill's skills that wasn't provided.\n\n**3. Lost Ark Character Stats**\nThe Lost Ark tool returned the six main character stats in the game:\n- Crit\n- Specialization\n- Domination\n- Swiftness\n- Endurance\n- Expertise\n\nThis is a basic list of the available stats, but doesn't provide specific information about character builds or optimal stat distribution for your friend's new account.\n\n**4. God of War Game Reviews**\nThe OpenCritic search returned 10 games related to \"God of War\" but didn't provide actual reviews:\n- God of War (exact match)\n- God of War Ragnar\u00f6k\n- God of Word\n- And several other games with similar names\n\nTo get actual reviews, you would need to select a specific game from this list and make another query.\n\n**5. Random Card Draw**\nYou drew the Ace of Spades (A\u2660) to determine which game you'll play first.\n\n**6. Dice Roll for Snack Selection**\nYou rolled a 3 on a six-sided die to determine which snack you'll have during matches.\n\n**7. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Details**\nUnfortunately, the Zelda API was unreachable when queried for information about Majora's Mask. The tool returned an error message indicating that the API is not working, so I can't provide details for your gaming trivia competition.\n\nIn summary, I was able to provide information on Pokemon Unite's Azumarill, basic Lost Ark stats, a list of God of War related games (but not reviews), a card draw (Ace of Spades), and a dice roll (3).

The Rocket League Blog tool returned an empty response, suggesting either an API issue or that no recent posts are available. I recommend checking the official Rocket League website or social media channels for the most current RLCS Finals information.\n\n## Lost Ark Engravings\nThe Lost Ark API successfully returned a comprehensive list of 42 engravings that pro players might be discussing:\n\n- Combat Engravings: Disrespect, Spirit Absorption, Grudge, Super Charge, Keen Blunt Weapon, Vital Point Strike, Master's Tenacity, Cursed Doll, Contender, Master of Ambush, Barricade, Raid Captain, Awakening, Master Brawler, Mass Increase, Hit Master, Adrenaline, All-out Attack, Precision Dagger\n- Utility Engravings: Ether Enhancement, Stabilized Status, Strong Will, Drops of Ether, Crisis Evasion, Increased Max MP, MP Regen, Master of Escape, Fortitude, Crushing Fist, Shield Piercing, Divine Protection, Heavy Armor, Explosive Expert, Enhanced Shield, Necromancy, Preemptive Strike, Broken Bone, Lightning Fury, Magick Stream, Propulsion, Expert, Emergency Rescue\n\n## Lost Ark Islands with Dropped Items\nThe API returned information about multiple islands with dropped items, but the response was truncated. The data shows that each island has various items identified by numeric IDs. For example:\n- First island: Items with IDs 133003, 510103, 889005, 889101\n- Second island: Items with IDs 201201, 403003, 889102, 6830302\n\nThe response was cut off after listing 20 islands, and unfortunately, the island names all appear as generic \"island\" rather than their actual names. This data is limited and would need further processing to be truly useful.\n\n## Hearthstone Cards\nThe Hearthstone Cards tool did not return any data. This could be due to an API issue or missing required parameters. Without this information, I cannot provide details about the cards that will be featured in the card game showcase.\n\n## Dice Roll Simulations\n### Regular Dice\nThe regular dice roll simulation returned results for 5 dice:\n- Individual rolls: [6, 3, 4, 6, 1]\n- Total: 20\n\n### Custom Dice\nThe custom dice simulation performed 5 rolls of 3 ten-sided dice each:\n- Roll 1: [1, 1, 5] = 7\n- Roll 2: [8, 10, 6] = 24\n- Roll 3: [3, 9, 6] = 18\n- Roll 4: [7, 6, 1] = 14\n- Roll 5: [2, 9, 3] = 14\n- Overall total: 77\n\nThese simulations could be used for predicting match outcomes or for gaming activities during the event.\n\n## Rocket League Game Deals\nThe CheapShark API returned several Rocket League-related deals, though the response was truncated. Available deals include:\n\n1. Rocket League x Monstercat Vol. 6 - $4.99\n2. Rocket League x Monstercat Vol. 7 - $4.99\n3. Rocket League x Monstercat Legacy - $2.99\n4. Rocket League - Season 19 Veteran Pack - $4.99\n\nThe response was cut off, so there may be additional deals available that weren't shown in the results.\n\n## Legend of Zelda Games\nUnfortunately, the Zelda API was unreachable. The tool returned an error message: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\" Therefore, I cannot provide information about which Legend of Zelda games will be featured in the gaming showcase segment.\n\n## Summary\nYour briefing for the Rocket League Championship Series Finals is incomplete due to several API limitations. I was able to provide information on Lost Ark engravings, partial data on Lost Ark islands with dropped items, dice roll simulations, and some Rocket League-related game deals. However, I couldn't retrieve the latest tournament news, Hearthstone cards information, or the list of Legend of Zelda games.

    "final_answer": "# eSports Weekend Preparation Information\n\n## Lost Ark Classes and Subclasses\nThe Lost Ark classes tool provided a complete list of all available character classes and their corresponding subclasses:\n\n- **Warrior**: Berserker, Paladin, Gunlancer\n- **Martial Artist**: Striker, Wardancer, Scrapper, Soulfist\n- **Gunner**: Gunslinger, Artillerist, Deadeye, Sharpshooter\n- **Mage**: Bard, Sorceress\n- **Assassin**: Shadowhunter, Deathblade\n\n## Lost Ark Engravings\nThe Lost Ark engravings tool returned a comprehensive list of available engravings for character enhancement. Here are some notable ones for team composition planning:\n\n- Combat engravings: Grudge, Super Charge, Keen Blunt Weapon, Cursed Doll, Raid Captain, Adrenaline\n- Support engravings: Expert, Awakening, Heavy Armor\n- Defensive engravings: Spirit Absorption, Stabilized Status, Heavy Armor, Enhanced Shield\n- Utility engravings: Drops of Ether, MP Regen, Explosive Expert\n\n## Chess Puzzles\nUnfortunately, the Chess Puzzles tool did not return any results despite requesting puzzles rated around 1800. This information is unavailable for your strategic practice.\n\n## Lost Ark Abyssal Dungeons\nThe Lost Ark abyssal dungeons tool provided a complete list of available dungeons and their item level requirements:\n\n- **Ancient Elveria**\n  - Demon Beast Canyon (iLvl 340)\n  - Necromancer's Origin (iLvl 340)\n- **Phantom Palace**\n  - Hall of the Twisted Warlord (iLvl 460)\n  - Hildebrandt Palace (iLvl 460)\n- **Ark of Arrogance**\n  - Road of Lament (iLvl 840)\n  - Forge of Fallen Pride (iLvl 840)\n- **Gate of Paradise**\n  - Sea of Indolence (iLvl 960)\n  - Tranquil Karkosa (iLvl 960)\n  - Alaric's Sanctuary (iLvl 960)\n- **Oreha's Well**\n  - Alirta's Oculus (iLvl 1325)\n  - Oreha Preveza (iLvl 1325)\n\n## Lost Ark Guardian Raids\nThe Lost Ark raids tool returned a complete list of guardian raids with their raid levels and item level requirements. Here's a summary organized by raid level:\n\n- **Raid Level 1** (iLvl 302-420): Ur'nil, Lumerus, Icy Legoros, Vertus\n- **Raid Level 2** (iLvl 460-580): Chromanius, Nacrasena, Flame Fox Yoho, Tytalos\n- **Raid Level 3** (iLvl 802-920): Dark Legoros, Helgaia, Calventus, Achates\n- **Raid Level 4** (iLvl 960-1080): Frost Helgaia, Lava Chromanium, Levanos, Alberhastic\n- **Raid Level 5** (iLvl 1302-1385): Armored Nacrasena, Igrexion, Night Fox Yoho, Velganos\n\n## Team Captain Selection\nThe dice roll simulator returned a result of **3**. You can use this to randomly select your team captain (e.g., if you have 6 team members, the 3rd person would be captain).\n\n## Batman Game Deals\nThe CheapShark tool returned several Batman game deals for your post-tournament celebration. Note that the output was cut off, so this is only a partial list:\n\n- LEGO Batman: $2.29\n- LEGO Batman 2: $3.29\n- Batman: Arkham VR: $2.49\n- LEGO Batman Trilogy: $4.99\n- Batman: Arkham Knight: $3.29\n\n## Lost Ark Island Items\nThe Lost Ark islands tool returned a list of islands with their dropped items, but the data is limited in usefulness as it only shows item IDs rather than item names. The output was also cut off before showing all islands. Here's a sample of what was returned:\n\n- Several islands with various item IDs (e.g., 133003, 510103, 889005)\n- Item quantities ranging from 1 to 10000+ for certain items\n- Some islands appear to have rare items (single quantity) while others have resources in bulk\n\nUnfortunately, without item names corresponding to the IDs, this information has limited practical value for resource planning.\n\nIn summary, you now have comprehensive information about Lost Ark classes, engravings, abyssal dungeons, and raids for your team planning. You also have a random number for team captain selection and some Batman game deals for your celebration. However, the chess puzzle information is missing, and the island item information is incomplete and lacks item names.",

This suggests either an error with the API connection or that no recent news is available through this particular tool. You may want to check the official Rocket League website directly for tournament updates.\n\n## 2. 2023 Hall of Fame Games\nThe OpenCritic API successfully returned information about 2023 Hall of Fame games. Here are the titles to add to your playlist:\n\n- **Baldur's Gate 3** (Score: 96) - Released August 3, 2023 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S\n- **The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom** (Score: 95) - Released May 12, 2023 for Nintendo Switch\n- **Videoverse** - Released August 7, 2023 (Note: The tool returned partial information for this game)\n\nThe tool output appears to have been truncated, so there may be additional Hall of Fame games not shown in these results.\n\n## 3. Chess Puzzles\nThe Chess Puzzles tool was executed but returned no output. Unfortunately, I cannot provide the requested chess puzzles rated around 1800 difficulty. You might need to visit a dedicated chess website like chess.com or lichess.org for appropriate puzzles.\n\n## 4. Pok\u00e9mon Unite Character Roster\nThe Pok\u00e9mon Unite tool was executed but returned no output. I cannot provide the current character roster based on these results. Consider checking the official Pok\u00e9mon Unite website or app for the most up-to-date roster.\n\n## 5. Lost Ark Class Options\nThe Lost Ark API successfully returned the available classes and subclasses:\n\n- **Warrior**: Berserker, Paladin, Gunlancer\n- **Martial Artist**: Striker, Wardancer, Scrapper, Soulfist\n- **Gunner**: Gunslinger, Artillerist, Deadeye, Sharpshooter\n- **Mage**: Bard, Sorceress\n- **Assassin**: Shadowhunter, Deathblade\n\n## 6. Custom Dice Rolls (3d8)\nThe Dice Roll Simulator successfully performed two rolls of three 8-sided dice:\n\n- First roll: [8, 4, 6] = 18\n- Second roll: [2, 5, 5] = 12\n- Total: 30\n\n## 7. Regular Dice Rolls\nThe Regular Dice Roll Simulator successfully performed two rolls of three standard dice:\n\n- First roll: [6, 5, 2] = 13\n- Second roll: [3, 1, 6] = 10\n- Total: 23\n\n## 8. Legend of Zelda Game with 'Majora' in the Title\nThe Legend of Zelda API returned an error message: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider\". However, based on general knowledge, the game you're looking for is likely \"The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask\", which was originally released for Nintendo 64 and later remastered for Nintendo 3DS.\n\n## Summary\nI've gathered information for your gaming weekend where possible. Several tools returned successful results (Hall of Fame games, Lost Ark classes, and dice rolls), while others encountered issues (Rocket League news, chess puzzles, Pok\u00e9mon Unite roster, and the Zelda API). For the missing information, you may need to check official websites or alternative sources.",

Can you list the first 20 Pok\u00e9mon characters in Pok\u00e9mon Unite? Also, what character classes are available in Lost Ark? For my tabletop gaming session, I need to roll some dice - specifically 3 eight-sided dice twice, and then 3 regular dice twice.

For my MOBA interests, would you mind showing me the first 20 Pok\u00e9mon available in Pokemon Unite? I'd also appreciate seeing all the character classes and subclasses in Lost Ark.

For my nephew's introduction to Pokemon Unite, which creatures might he encounter first? He's also interested in Lost Ark and wondering about the different warrior paths available. For our tabletop night, we need some fortune telling - what outcomes might we see if we roll three of those special octagonal dice twice? And for our traditional board game, what numbers might appear if we roll three regular dice a couple of times?"

I cannot provide you with the latest news about Rocket League at this time.\n\n### Player Population\nThe Rocket League Population tool shows the game is very active with **297,649 players online** currently. Here's the breakdown by playlist:\n\n- **Ranked Playlists**:\n  - Doubles (Ranked): 45,591 players (highest population)\n  - Standard (Ranked): 30,900 players\n  - Duel (Ranked): 5,947 players\n\n- **Casual Playlists**:\n  - Doubles: 26,083 players\n  - Standard: 22,917 players\n  - Rumble: 6,042 players\n  - Chaos: 4,159 players\n  - Duel: 3,932 players\n  - Hoops: 2,429 players\n  - Dropshot: 1,931 players\n  - Snow Day: 1,555 players\n\nThis indicates a healthy competitive scene with ranked modes being particularly popular.\n\n## Lost Ark\n\n### Engravings List\nThe Lost Ark engravings tool returned a list of 42 available engravings, including 'Grudge' which you specifically asked about. Other notable engravings include Cursed Doll, Adrenaline, Awakening, and Hit Master.\n\n### Grudge Engraving Details\nUnfortunately, the specific item lookup for 'Grudge' returned no data, so I cannot provide details about this engraving.\n\n### Harmony Island Drops\nThe tool returned a list of islands with their dropped items, but the data appears to be incomplete (the output was cut off) and doesn't specifically identify which island is Harmony Island. The data shows item IDs rather than item names, making it difficult to interpret without additional context.\n\n## The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask\nThe Zelda API tool returned an error message: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\" I cannot provide information about Majora's Mask at this time.\n\n## Steam Giveaways\nThe GamerPower tool for Steam giveaways sorted by popularity returned no data, so I cannot provide information about current free gaming giveaways on Steam.\n\n## Chess Middlegame Puzzles\nThe Chess Puzzles tool returned no data despite requesting middlegame puzzles rated around 1500. I cannot provide chess puzzles at this time.\n\n## D&D Dice Rolls\nThe Dice Roll Simulator successfully rolled 3 sets of 4 dice each. Here are your results:\n\n- **Roll 1**: [1, 5, 6, 6] = 18\n- **Roll 2**: [1, 1, 2, 1] = 5\n- **Roll 3**: [5, 6, 1, 3] = 15\n\nTotal across all rolls: 38\n\n## Summary\nI was able to provide you with current Rocket League player population data (showing a healthy competitive scene with nearly 300,000 players online) and a list of Lost Ark engravings (though not specific details about Grudge). I also successfully rolled dice for your D&D session. Unfortunately, several tools returned no data or errors, including Rocket League news, Grudge engraving details, Harmony Island drops (partial data only), Zelda Majora's Mask information, Steam giveaways, and chess puzzles.",

This could be because you don't have any recent matches recorded in the system, or there was an issue with the API connection.\n\n## 2. Free Games Available\n### Epic Games Store\nThe Epic Games Store tool returned information about one free game currently available:\n- **Outliver: Tribulation**: A survival-horror game with souls-like elements based on African mythology. You play as a soldier trapped in a supernatural realm who must participate in an ancient ritual to escape.\n\nUnfortunately, the tool output was cut off mid-response, so there may be additional free games that weren't displayed in the results.\n\n### Steam Free Games\nThe GamerPower tool was executed to find free Steam games but returned no data. This could indicate an API issue or that there are currently no free game promotions on Steam.\n\n## 3. Legend of Zelda Game Recommendations\nThe Zelda API returned an error message: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\" Unfortunately, I cannot provide Legend of Zelda game recommendations at this time due to this technical issue.\n\n## 4. Rocket League Challenges\nThe Rocket League Challenges tool returned an error: \"params/type must be equal to one of the allowed values.\" It seems the parameter value 'seasonal' is not accepted by the API. Without knowing the correct parameter values, I cannot provide information about Rocket League challenges.\n\n## 5. The Witcher 3 Reviews\nThe OpenCritic search tool found several Witcher-related games, with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt being the closest match (similarity score: 0.36363637). Other related titles include:\n- The Witcher Adventure Game\n- Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales\n- The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine (DLC)\n- The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone (DLC)\n\nHowever, the tool only returned search results, not actual reviews or ratings for these games.\n\n## 6. Cards for a Drinking Game\nThe Card Draw Simulator successfully drew 5 cards from a standard deck:\n- 10 of Diamonds\n- 2 of Hearts\n- 8 of Spades\n- King of Spades\n- 9 of Hearts\n\nYou can use these cards to start your drinking game!\n\n## 7. Gaming Author Information\nThe author search for \"Travis North\" returned several similar names, with Travis Northup being the closest match (similarity score: 0.25). Other gaming authors with similar names include:\n- Travis Bruno\n- Travis White\n- Travis Huber\n- Dale North\n\nHowever, no detailed information about these authors was provided beyond their names.\n\n## 8. Die Roll for Snack Decision\nThe die roll simulator returned a result of 3. You can use this to decide which snack to buy based on your predetermined list (e.g., if you had 6 snack options numbered 1-6, you should choose option #3).\n\n## 9. Upcoming Rocket League Tournaments\nNo tool was executed specifically for upcoming Rocket League tournaments, so I cannot provide information on this topic.\n\n## Summary\nI've gathered some information to help with your gaming weekend, including one free game on Epic Games Store (Outliver: Tribulation), cards for your drinking game (10\u2666, 2\u2665, 8\u2660, K\u2660, 9\u2665), and a die roll result of 3 for your snack decision.

The tool returned information about several Elden Ring products, including the base game and DLC:\n\n- **ELDEN RING SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE (DLC)**: $34.95 (cheapest price found)\n- **ELDEN RING (Base Game)**: $44.95\n- **ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN**: $34.99\n- **ELDEN RING Deluxe Edition**: $79.99\n\nNote: The tool only returned partial results for each game, so there may be other stores with different pricing not shown here.\n\n## Lost Ark Information\n\n### Top Level 5 Guardian Raids\nThe Lost Ark API returned these Level 5 raids with their required item levels:\n- Armored Nacrasena (Item Level 1302)\n- Igrexion (Item Level 1340)\n- Night Fox Yoho (Item Level 1370)\n- Velganos (Item Level 1385)\n\n### Available Engravings\nThe tool returned a comprehensive list of 42 engravings in Lost Ark including:\nDisrespect, Spirit Absorption, Grudge, Super Charge, Keen Blunt Weapon, Cursed Doll, Raid Captain, Awakening, Adrenaline, and many more. These are crucial for optimizing your character builds for raids.\n\n### Farming Locations\nThe Lost Ark farming locations tool returned data for multiple islands with their dropped items, but unfortunately only showed item IDs rather than item names (e.g., \"island with items: {133003: 1, 510103: 1, 889005: 30, 889101: 1}\"). This makes it difficult to identify specific farming locations without item name translations.\n\n## Pok\u00e9mon Unite - Azumarill Stats\nThe tool provided detailed information about Azumarill in Pok\u00e9mon Unite:\n\n- **Tier**: B (Recently downgraded)\n- **Role**: All-Rounder (Melee)\n- **Difficulty**: Novice\n- **Damage Type**: Physical\n\n**Recommended Builds**:\n1. **Aqua Pulse Build**:\n   - Lane: Center Share / Path Damage\n   - Held Items: Attack Weight, Focus Band, Weakness Policy\n   - Battle Item: X Speed (Optional: Full Heal)\n   - Moves: Bubble \u2192 Tackle \u2192 Aqua Tail \u2192 Water Pulse\n\n2. **Whirl Pulse Build**:\n   - Similar items but with Whirlpool instead of Aqua Tail\n\n**Special Note**: Azumarill's attacks can critically strike but only deal 150% damage instead of the standard 200%.\n\n## Chess Puzzles\nUnfortunately, the Chess Puzzles tool did not return any results for the 1800 rating puzzles requested.\n\n## Final Fantasy XVI Reviews\nThe OpenCritic API returned search results for Final Fantasy games, with Final Fantasy XVI being the perfect match. However, it only provided game IDs and similarity scores without actual review information:\n\n- Final Fantasy XVI (ID: 14516, perfect match)\n- Final Fantasy XV (ID: 1512, 83% similarity)\n- Final Fantasy VI (ID: 2168, 74% similarity)\n\nNo actual review content was provided.\n\n## Poker Night Card Draw Simulation\nThe Card Draw Simulator successfully drew 5 random cards from a standard deck:\n- 10 of Diamonds\n- 2 of Hearts\n- 8 of Spades\n- King of Spades\n- 9 of Hearts\n\n## eSports Tournaments\nNo information was returned about upcoming eSports tournaments as no tool was executed for this request.\n\n## Summary of Missing Information\nSeveral parts of your request couldn't be fully addressed with the tools used:\n- Chess puzzles returned no results\n- Lost Ark farming locations showed only item IDs, not names\n- Final Fantasy XVI reviews weren't provided, only game IDs\n- No information on upcoming eSports tournaments was retrieved\n- Detailed stats for other Pok\u00e9mon Unite characters besides Azumarill weren't provided",

For chess enthusiasts, I requested 5 chess puzzles rated around 1800 with 'endgame' and 'advantage' themes requiring 3 player moves. I searched the OpenCritic database for reviews and information about 'Final Fantasy XVI'.

My friend keeps talking about that blue rabbit Pok\u00e9mon in Unite - apparently it's an All-Rounder with some unique critical hit mechanics? For my chess practice, I need some endgame scenarios where one side has a clear advantage - something around tournament level difficulty requiring precise calculation. That new Final Fantasy just released - how's it being received by critics? For efficient farming in that Korean MMO, which islands drop the most valuable items?

This could be because you don't have any recent matches in the database or there was an issue with the tool.\n\n## Rocket League News\nThe Rocket League News tool returned an empty response ({}), suggesting there might be no recent news available or there was an issue with the API connection.\n\n## Gaming Giveaways Sorted by Value\nThe GamerPower tool was called to sort giveaways by value, but no results were returned. This could be due to an API limitation or temporary unavailability.\n\n## Entertainment Trivia\nThe Trivia tool returned an error: \"limit parameter is for premium subscribers only.\" This indicates that requesting multiple trivia questions (5 were requested) requires a premium subscription to the service.\n\n## God of War Reviews Search\nThe OpenCritic API successfully returned search results for \"God of War\":\n\nTop matches (by relevance):\n1. God of War (exact match)\n2. God of War Ragnar\u00f6k\n3. God of Word\n4. Gems of War\n5. Gears of War 4\n\nAnd several other related titles. To get actual reviews, you would need to select a specific game from this list for further details.\n\n## Dice Roll Results\nThe Dice Roll Simulator successfully rolled 3 dice with the following results:\n- Die 1: 6\n- Die 2: 5\n- Die 3: 1\n- Total: 12\n\nThese can be used for your drinking game!\n\n## Card Draw Results\nThe Card Draw Simulator successfully drew 10 spades cards from the deck:\n4\u2660, 6\u2660, 9\u2660, Q\u2660, A\u2660, 5\u2660, 10\u2660, 7\u2660, 3\u2660, 8\u2660\n\nThese cards are ready for your poker night, though note that only spades were drawn (not a complete poker hand from all suits).\n\n## Chess Puzzles\nThe Chess Puzzles tool was called with a specific puzzle ID (HxxIU), but no data was returned. This could be because the puzzle ID doesn't exist or there was an issue with the tool.\n\n## Hearthstone Cards\nThe Hearthstone Cards tool was called to retrieve cards (page 1, limit 5), but no data was returned. This could be due to an API limitation or temporary unavailability.\n\n## Lost Ark Engravings\nThe Lost Ark tool successfully returned a comprehensive list of available engravings in the game:\n\nSome notable engravings include:\n- Grudge\n- Spirit Absorption\n- Adrenaline\n- Cursed Doll\n- Keen Blunt Weapon\n- Awakening\n- Expert\n- Heavy Armor\n\nAnd many more (42 engravings total). Your friend who just started playing can explore these options for character enhancement.\n\n## Summary\nI've gathered some information for your gaming weekend, though several tools had limited or no results. You have dice roll results for your drinking game, a set of spades cards for poker night, a list of God of War games if you want to look up reviews, and a comprehensive list of Lost Ark engravings to share with your friend.

My chess buddy mentioned a specific puzzle he couldn't solve - something with the code HxxIU. Oh, and could you show me a handful of those digital collectible cards from that Blizzard game?

This could be due to an API error or no available data at the moment. You'll need to check another source for upcoming CS:GO matches to watch during your gaming weekend.\n\n## 2. Lost Ark Classes Information\nThe Lost Ark classes tool provided complete information about all available character classes and their subclasses:\n\n- **Warrior**: Berserker, Paladin, Gunlancer\n- **Martial Artist**: Striker, Wardancer, Scrapper, Soulfist\n- **Gunner**: Gunslinger, Artillerist, Deadeye, Sharpshooter\n- **Mage**: Bard, Sorceress\n- **Assassin**: Shadowhunter, Deathblade\n\n## 3. Lost Ark Level 3 Raids\nThe tool successfully returned information about all Level 3 raids in Lost Ark:\n\n| Raid Name | Item Level Required |\n|-----------|--------------------|\n| Dark Legoros | 802 |\n| Helgaia | 840 |\n| Calventus | 880 |\n| Achates | 920 |\n\n## 4. Lost Ark Islands with Dropped Items\nThe tool returned a list of islands with their dropped items, but the output was truncated. The data shows 20 different islands with various item IDs and quantities, but the complete list was cut off. Each island has multiple items identified by numeric IDs (e.g., '133003', '510103'), but without item names, this information has limited usefulness.\n\n## 5. Custom Dice Roll (4d10)\nThe dice roll simulator successfully rolled four 10-sided dice:\n- Results: [10, 1, 9, 1]\n- Total: 21\n\n## 6. D&D Die Roll (1d20)\nThe single 20-sided die roll resulted in: 8\n\n## 7. Poker Night Card Draw\nThe card draw simulator successfully drew 5 cards from a standard deck:\n- Cards drawn: 10\u2666, 2\u2665, 8\u2660, K\u2660, 9\u2665\n\n## 8. Upcoming Rocket League Tournaments in Europe\nThe Rocket League tournaments tool was executed but returned an empty object ({}). This suggests either there are no upcoming tournaments in Europe at the moment, or there was an issue with the API request.\n\n## 9. 2023 Gaming Hall of Fame\nThe OpenCritic API returned information about games that made the 2023 Hall of Fame, but the output was truncated. From what was returned, we can see:\n\n1. **Baldur's Gate 3** - Released August 3, 2023 (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S) with a 96 critic score, Tier: Mighty\n2. **The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom** - Released May 12, 2023 (Nintendo Switch) with a 95 critic score, Tier: Mighty\n3. **Videoverse** - Released August 7, 2023, Tier: Mighty (additional details were cut off)\n\n## 10. Gaming-Related Trivia Questions\nThe trivia tool returned an error message: \"limit parameter is for premium subscribers only.\" This means we couldn't retrieve the 3 gaming-related trivia questions you requested.\n\n## Summary\nFor your gaming weekend, you now have information about Lost Ark classes and Level 3 raids, dice roll results for your tabletop session (4d10 totaling 21 and a d20 roll of 8), and 5 cards drawn for poker night (10\u2666, 2\u2665, 8\u2660, K\u2660, 9\u2665). You also have partial information about the 2023 Gaming Hall of Fame. However, you'll need to find alternative sources for CS:GO matches, complete Lost Ark island drop information, Rocket League tournaments in Europe, and gaming trivia questions as these tools either returned incomplete data or no data at all.",

For my tabletop session later, I need some probability tools - specifically something that could generate four random numbers between 1-10, a single result from 1-20, and a small hand of playing cards.

    "final_answer": "# Lost Ark Gaming Session Optimization\n\n## Islands with Rare Materials\nI used the Lost Ark island drops tool to find farming locations, but unfortunately the data returned is incomplete. The tool provided information about 20 islands, but each island is simply labeled as 'island' without specific names, making it difficult to plan an efficient route. Additionally, the item drops are listed only by ID numbers (like '133003', '510103') without descriptions of what these items actually are.\n\nThe tool output was also cut off mid-response, so we're only seeing a partial list of all available islands. This limitation makes it challenging to provide you with a comprehensive farming route as requested.\n\n## D&D-Style Guild Event Dice Rolls\nI've simulated the 3d20 dice rolls 5 times for your in-game custom mini-game. Here are the results:\n\n| Roll # | Individual Dice | Subtotal |\n|--------|----------------|----------|\n| 1      | 8, 1, 5        | 14       |\n| 2      | 9, 9, 5        | 23       |\n| 3      | 11, 15, 20     | 46       |\n| 4      | 18, 19, 12     | 49       |\n| 5      | 1, 14, 15      | 30       |\n\nTotal across all rolls: 162\n\n## Batman Game Deals Under $15\nI checked for Batman game deals and found several options under $15:\n\n1. **LEGO Batman** - $2.29\n2. **LEGO Batman 2** - $3.29\n3. **Batman: Arkham VR** - $2.49\n4. **LEGO Batman Trilogy** - $4.99\n5. **Batman: Arkham Knight** - $3.29\n\nNote that the tool results were cut off, so there might be additional Batman games on sale that weren't included in this list. Each game listing includes the title, price, and a thumbnail image link, but the complete details about platforms, stores offering these deals, and sale end dates were not provided.\n\n## Summary\nWhile I've provided your dice roll results and Batman game deals under $15, the Lost Ark island information was unfortunately limited and lacks the specific details needed to plan an efficient farming route.

There are currently **297,649 players online** across various playlists.

With this many players online, you might experience some server load, particularly in the popular ranked modes.\n\n## Rocket League News\nUnfortunately, the Rocket League News tool returned an empty result ({}). I cannot provide you with the latest news and updates about Rocket League at this time. You might want to check the official Rocket League website or social media channels for recent announcements.\n\n## Card Draw for Poker\nI've drawn 7 cards from a standard deck for your poker game:\n- Jack of Spades (J\u2660)\n- 3 of Spades (3\u2660)\n- 2 of Spades (2\u2660)\n- Queen of Spades (Q\u2660)\n- 8 of Spades (8\u2660)\n- 7 of Spades (7\u2660)\n- King of Spades (K\u2660)\n\nInterestingly, all cards drawn are spades, giving you a flush if you were to use these in a poker hand.\n\n## Batman Game Deals Under $20\nI found several Batman games currently on sale for under $20:\n\n1. LEGO Batman - $2.29\n2. LEGO Batman 2 - $3.29\n3. Batman: Arkham VR - $2.49\n4. LEGO Batman Trilogy - $4.99\n5. Batman: Arkham Knight - $3.29\n\nNote: The tool output was cut off after the fifth game, so there may be additional Batman games available under $20 that aren't listed here.\n\n## Summary\nYour gaming night is looking good! Rocket League servers have a healthy population but might be busy in the ranked modes. I couldn't retrieve the latest Rocket League news. For your card game, I've drawn 7 cards (all spades).

However, the output appears to be truncated, showing only the top 3 games with incomplete information for the third entry. Here are the details from what was returned:\n\n1. **Baldur's Gate 3**\n   - Release Date: August 3, 2023\n   - Tier: Mighty\n   - Top Critic Score: 96\n   - Platforms: PC (Aug 3), PlayStation 5 (Sep 6), Xbox Series X/S (Aug 3)\n\n2. **The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom**\n   - Release Date: May 12, 2023\n   - Tier: Mighty\n   - Top Critic Score: 95\n   - Platforms: Nintendo Switch\n\n3. **Videoverse**\n   - Release Date: August 7, 2023\n   - Tier: Mighty\n   - Note: The information for this game was cut off in the API response\n\n## Summary\nI couldn't provide any Rocket League meta updates due to the empty API response. For your next game consideration, Baldur's Gate 3 and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom were among the highest-rated games of 2023 according to OpenCritic, both achieving the prestigious \"Mighty\" tier with scores of 96 and 95 respectively.

Steam Giveaways and Loot Drops\n\n**Note: The GamerPower tool execution appears to have failed or returned no data.** While the tool was called with the correct parameters (platform: steam, sort-by: popularity, type: loot), no output was provided in the results. You may want to check this information manually on sites like GamerPower.com or similar gaming giveaway aggregators.\n\n## 2. Digital PC Game Stores for Price Comparison\n\nThe CheapShark tool provided a list of digital PC game stores for price comparison. Here are the active stores from the results:\n\n- Steam (ID: 1)\n- GamersGate (ID: 2)\n- GreenManGaming (ID: 3)\n- GOG (ID: 7)\n- Origin (ID: 8)\n- Humble Store (ID: 11)\n\n**Note: The tool output appears to be truncated.** The data shows several inactive stores as well (Amazon, GameStop, Direct2Drive, Get Games, Shiny Loot, and Desura), but the complete list may include additional stores that weren't shown in the results.\n\n## 3. D&D Dice Roll Results\n\nThe Dice Roll Simulator successfully rolled three 8-sided dice with the following results:\n- Die 1: 6\n- Die 2: 3\n- Die 3: 4\n- **Total: 13**\n\n## 4. Poker Warm-up Cards\n\nThe Card Draw Simulator successfully drew 5 cards from a standard deck. However, it appears the tool was configured to only draw spades (\u2660). Your drawn cards are:\n- 9\u2660\n- 5\u2660\n- 7\u2660\n- A\u2660\n- Q\u2660\n\n**Note: The cards drawn are all spades due to the suit parameter being set to \u2660. For a standard poker draw, you might want to draw from all suits.**\n\n## Summary\n\nYour gaming night preparation is partially complete. You have your D&D dice roll results (total of 13) and poker cards (though all spades). The list of active digital PC game stores is available for price comparison, though it may be incomplete.

Level 3 Raids Information\n\nHere are the Level 3 raids available in Lost Ark with their required item levels:\n\n| Raid Name | Required Item Level |\n|-----------|--------------------|\n| Dark Legoros | 802 |\n| Helgaia | 840 |\n| Calventus | 880 |\n| Achates | 920 |\n\nMake sure your party meets the minimum item level requirements for these raids, with Achates being the highest at 920.\n\n## 3.

Diablo IV Price Deals\n\nHere are the current best deals for Diablo IV across different editions:\n\n| Game Version | Cheapest Price |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| Diablo IV (Standard) | $49.99 |\n| Diablo IV - Standard Edition | $69.99 |\n| Diablo IV - Digital Deluxe Edition | $89.99 |\n| Diablo IV - Ultimate Edition | $99.99 |\n\nThe base version of Diablo IV is currently available for $49.99, with premium editions ranging up to $99.99 for the Ultimate Edition.\n\n## Summary\n\nYou're now ready for your Lost Ark gaming session!

    "final_answer": "# Gaming Weekend Preparation Results\n\n## Rocket League Tournaments in Europe\nI checked for Rocket League tournaments in Europe this weekend, but unfortunately, the tool returned an empty result ({}). This could mean either there are no tournaments scheduled, the data is unavailable, or there might have been an issue with the API request. You may want to check the official Rocket League website or social media for more reliable tournament information.\n\n## Free Games on Epic Games Store\nThe tool provided information about currently available free games on the Epic Games Store, though the data appears to be truncated. Here's what I could gather:\n\n- **Outliver: Tribulation**: A survival-horror game with souls-like elements based on African mythology. You play as a soldier trapped in a supernatural realm who must participate in an ancient ritual to escape.\n  - Publisher: Plug In Digital SAS\n  - Status: ACTIVE\n\nNote that the response was cut off mid-way, so there might be additional free games available that weren't included in the results.\n\n## Card Draw Simulation\nI successfully simulated drawing 7 cards from a standard deck for your game mechanic testing. Here are the cards drawn:\n- 10\u2660\n- 2\u2660\n- 3\u2660\n- Q\u2660\n- J\u2660\n- 4\u2660\n- 9\u2660\n\nInterestingly, all cards drawn were spades, which is quite unusual. This might be because the optional parameter was set to only draw spades ('suit': '\u2660').\n\n## Free-to-Play MMORPG Games with PvP for PC\nThe tool returned several MMORPG games with PvP elements that are free-to-play on PC:\n\n1. **Blade and Soul**\n   - Description: A martial arts MMORPG with combination attacks\n   - Publisher: NCSoft\n   - Developer: NCSoft\n   - Release Date: January 19, 2016\n\n2. **Trove**\n   - Description: A sandbox MMORPG\n   - Publisher: Trion Worlds\n   - Developer: Trion Worlds\n   - Release Date: July 9, 2015\n\n3. **ArcheAge**\n   - Description: A hybrid fantasy/sandbox MMORPG\n   - Publisher: Kakao Games\n   - Developer: XL Games\n   - Release Date: September 4, 2014\n\n4. **Neverwinter**\n   - Description: A 3D action MMORPG based on Dungeons & Dragons\n   - Publisher: Perfect World Entertainment\n   - Developer: Cryptic Studios\n   - Release Date: December 6, 2013\n\n5. **Guild Wars 2**\n   - Description: Follow-up to ArenaNet's popular Guild Wars\n   - Note: The description was cut off in the results\n\nThe response appears to be truncated, so there might be additional games that weren't included in the results.\n\n## Upcoming CS:GO Matches\nUnfortunately, the tool did not return any data for upcoming CS:GO matches this weekend. The output field is empty, which could indicate an error with the API or that no matches are currently scheduled. I recommend checking official CS:GO esports websites or platforms like HLTV.org for the most current match information.\n\n## Pok\u00e9mon Unite Characters\nThe tool did not return any data about Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Unite. The output field is empty, which could indicate an API error or access issue. For team composition strategies, I recommend visiting the official Pok\u00e9mon Unite website or community sites like Unite-DB for up-to-date character information.\n\n## Summary\nFor your gaming weekend, I was able to provide information on one free game from Epic Games Store (though the data was incomplete), simulated a 7-card draw (all spades), and found several free-to-play MMORPG games with PvP elements for PC. Unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve information about Rocket League tournaments in Europe, upcoming CS:GO matches, or Pok\u00e9mon Unite characters due to empty responses from the tools.

To get complete information about reviews, we would need to make additional queries for each specific game.\n\n## 2. UK Pok\u00e9dex Information\nI retrieved Pok\u00e9mon data from the UK Pok\u00e9dex, but the results appear to be truncated. The tool only returned the first 7 Pok\u00e9mon (Bulbasaur through Squirtle), with the Squirtle entry being cut off mid-response. This is only a tiny fraction of the complete Pok\u00e9dex, which would contain hundreds of Pok\u00e9mon. For a complete list to settle your argument about rare types, we would need the full dataset.\n\n## 3. Video Game Trivia Questions\nUnfortunately, the trivia tool returned an error message: \"limit parameter is for premium subscribers only.\" This means we couldn't retrieve the 5 video game trivia questions you requested for your gaming quiz.\n\n## 4. Chess Puzzle\nThe Chess Puzzles tool did not return any results. It appears the request was made with an optional parameter 'id: HxxIU', but no puzzle data was returned. To get a challenging chess puzzle, we would need to try a different approach or puzzle ID.\n\n## 5. Lost Ark Classes\nI successfully retrieved information about Lost Ark classes for your friend. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- **Warrior**: Berserker, Paladin, Gunlancer\n- **Martial Artist**: Striker, Wardancer, Scrapper, Soulfist\n- **Gunner**: Gunslinger, Artillerist, Deadeye, Sharpshooter\n- **Mage**: Bard, Sorceress\n- **Assassin**: Shadowhunter, Deathblade\n\nThis provides a complete overview of the main classes and their subclasses in Lost Ark.\n\n## 6. Hearthstone Card: A Light in the Darkness\nI found detailed information about the Hearthstone card \"A Light in the Darkness\":\n\n- **Mana Cost**: 2\n- **Type**: Spell (Holy)\n- **Class**: Paladin\n- **Rarity**: Common\n- **Text**: \"Discover a minion. Give it +1/+1.\"\n- **Set**: Whispers of the Old Gods\n- **Flavor Text**: \"Wait, how can you have a light in the dark? If you turn on a light while it's dark, doesn't that mean it's no longer dark?\"\n\nThe card has the Discover keyword, which lets you choose one of three cards to add to your hand.\n\n## Summary\nI was able to provide complete information about Lost Ark classes and the Hearthstone card \"A Light in the Darkness\" for your gaming session. However, I could only provide partial results for God of War games (just titles, no reviews), and a very limited portion of the UK Pok\u00e9dex.

Chess Puzzles\n\nUnfortunately, the Chess Puzzles tool did not return any results despite the request for middlegame puzzles around 1500 rating. This tool appears to have failed or timed out.\n\n## 3. Upcoming CSGO Matches\n\nThe CSGO matches tool did not return any results.

Speaking of free stuff, which current game giveaways would give me the most value for zero dollars? For my tabletop gaming night, I need to know what happens when we roll four dice three times in a row. I've also been exploring Lost Ark - what are the main character stats I should focus on, and which islands drop the most interesting items?

Rocket League Tournaments in US-East\nUnfortunately, the Tournaments tool returned a timeout error. The API took too long to respond, so I couldn't retrieve information about tournaments in the US-East region tonight. You may want to check the official Rocket League game or website for this information.\n\n## 3. Rocket League Weekly Challenges\nThe Challenges tool returned an empty response ({}), suggesting either there are no current weekly challenges or the API couldn't retrieve this information. You might want to check in-game for the most accurate challenge information.\n\n## 4. Chess Puzzle\nThe Chess Puzzles tool did not return any data for puzzle ID: HxxIU. The output was empty, suggesting either the puzzle ID is incorrect or there was an issue retrieving the puzzle.\n\n## 5. Random Trivia Question\nThe Trivia tool returned an error indicating that the \"limit\" parameter is for premium subscribers only. Unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve a random trivia question for your gaming marathon.\n\n## 6. Regular Die Roll\nI rolled a regular six-sided die to determine who goes first, and the result is: **3**\n\n## 7. Custom Dice Roll for Team Captains\nI rolled three 20-sided dice for team captains with the following results:\n- Die 1: 4\n- Die 2: 20\n- Die 3: 10\n- Total: 34\n\n## 8. Hearthstone Card: A Light in the Darkness\nI retrieved details for the Hearthstone card \"A Light in the Darkness\":\n\n- **Name**: A Light in the Darkness\n- **Mana Cost**: 2\n- **Type**: Spell (Holy)\n- **Class**: Paladin\n- **Rarity**: Common\n- **Text**: Discover a minion. Give it +1/+1.\n- **Flavor Text**: \"Wait, how can you have a light in the dark? If you turn on a light while it's dark, doesn't that mean it's no longer dark?\"\n- **Set**: Whispers of the Old Gods\n- **Artist**: Zoltan Boros\n\n## 9. Comprehensive List of Hearthstone Cards\nThe Hearthstone Cards tool did not return any data. The output was empty, so I couldn't retrieve the comprehensive list of Hearthstone cards (page 1, 10 per page) to help with deck construction.\n\n## Summary\nI've provided information on Rocket League's current player population (showing good activity across playlists), dice roll results for your gaming session (regular die: 3, custom dice: 4, 20, 10), and details on the Hearthstone card \"A Light in the Darkness\". However, several tools returned errors or empty responses, including the Rocket League tournaments and challenges tools, the chess puzzle retrieval, the trivia question generator, and the Hearthstone cards list.

Here's what you should know:\n\n## General Information\n- **Tier Ranking**: B Tier (recently downgraded)\n- **Role**: All-Rounder\n- **Attack Type**: Physical\n- **Range**: Melee\n- **Difficulty**: Novice\n- **Last Updated**: January 13, 2023 (note that this may not reflect the absolute latest meta)\n\n## Unique Passive: Huge Power\nAzumarill's passive ability ensures that when hitting only a single enemy with a basic attack, move, or Unite Move, the hit is always a critical hit (150% damage instead of the standard 200%). However, when hitting multiple enemies simultaneously, no critical hits occur.\n\n## Recommended Builds\n\n### Build 1: Aqua Pulse\n- **Lane**: Center Share / Path Damage\n- **Held Items**: Attack Weight, Focus Band, Weakness Policy\n- **Battle Item**: X Speed (Alternative: Full Heal)\n- **Basic Moves**: Bubble, Tackle\n- **Upgrade Path**: Aqua Tail, Water Pulse\n\n### Build 2: Whirl Pulse\n- **Lane**: Center Share / Path Damage\n- **Held Items**: Attack Weight, Focus Band, Weakness Policy\n- **Battle Item**: X Speed (Alternative: Full Heal)\n- **Basic Moves**: Bubble, Tackle\n- **Upgrade Path**: Whirlpool, Water Pulse\n\n## Evolution Path\nAzumarill evolves from Marill at level 4.\n\n## Special Note\nAll of Marill and Azumarill's attacks and damaging moves can critically strike, but the damage is 150% instead of the standard 200%.\n\n**Note**: The tool response for Azumarill's skills was cut off, so I'm unable to provide complete information about all its moves and skills.\n\n# Rocket League Player Population\n\nAccording to the current data, there are **297,649 players** online across all Rocket League playlists. Here's the breakdown by playlist:\n\n## Ranked Playlists\n- **Doubles (Ranked)**: 45,591 players (highest population)\n- **Standard (Ranked)**: 30,900 players\n- **Duel (Ranked)**: 5,947 players\n\n## Casual Playlists\n- **Doubles**: 26,083 players\n- **Standard**: 22,917 players\n- **Chaos**: 4,159 players\n- **Duel**: 3,932 players\n\n## Extra Modes\n- **Rumble**: 6,042 players\n- **Hoops**: 2,429 players\n- **Dropshot**: 1,931 players\n- **Snow Day**: 1,555 players (lowest population)\n\n# OpenCritic Hall of Fame 2021\n\nHere are some of the games that made the OpenCritic Hall of Fame for 2021 (the year Pok\u00e9mon Unite was released):\n\n1. **Forza Horizon 5**\n   - Release Date: November 9, 2021\n   - Top Critic Score: 92\n   - Tier: Mighty\n   - Platforms: PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S\n\n2. **Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury**\n   - Release Date: February 12, 2021\n   - Top Critic Score: 89\n   - Tier: Mighty\n   - Platform: Nintendo Switch\n\n3. **Bustafellows**\n   - Release Date: July 30, 2021\n   - Top Critic Score: 89\n   - Tier: Mighty\n   - Platform: PC\n\n**Note**: The Hall of Fame list appears to be incomplete in the tool response.

This tool appears to have failed or timed out, so I cannot provide the requested information about the Grudge engraving.\n\n## 3. Upcoming CS:GO Matches\nThe CS:GO matches tool returned no data. This could be due to an API error, timeout, or possibly no upcoming matches in the database. You'll need to check another source for your viewing party planning.\n\n## 4. 2022 Hall of Fame Games\nThe OpenCritic API returned information about 2022 Hall of Fame games, though the response appears to be truncated. From what was returned:\n\n1. **Elden Ring**\n   - Release Date: February 25, 2022\n   - Tier: Mighty\n   - Top Critic Score: 95\n   - Platforms: PC, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, PlayStation 4\n\n2. **God of War Ragnar\u00f6k**\n   - Release Date: November 9, 2022\n   - Tier: Mighty\n   - Top Critic Score: 92\n   - Platforms: PlayStation 4 (and likely PS5, though data was cut off)\n\nNote that this appears to be a partial list as the response was truncated.\n\n## 5.

Custom 20-sided Die Roll\nThe custom die roll simulator successfully rolled a 20-sided die with the result: **8**\n\n## 7.

The response included 5 complete puzzles and 1 partial puzzle, each with:\n- Puzzle ID\n- FEN notation (board position)\n- Rating (around 1500)\n- Required moves\n- Themes (e.g., advantage, fork, middlegame)\n\nNote that the response appears to be truncated, as it mentioned returning 10 puzzles but only provided complete data for 5.\n\n## 10.

However, several tools returned incomplete or no information: the Grudge engraving details were missing, no CS:GO matches were returned, Rocket League challenges returned empty, and the Elden Ring search didn't provide actual reviews. You may need additional sources for these missing pieces of information.",

Also, I'm trying to follow the competitive scene - are there any professional matches happening soon in that tactical shooter with bomb defusal? And which titles made the critics' top selections last year? For my tabletop session tonight, I need some probability practice - what would happen if I tossed a handful of regular cubes and one of those special ones with many more sides? By the way, I've been reading reviews by this critic who I think is named Travis something - does he have a profile somewhere? For my chess practice, I could use some moderate difficulty challenges around my current skill level.

Rocket League Population & Tournaments\n\nThe Rocket League Population tool shows there are currently **297,649 players online** across various playlists. The most populated modes are:\n- Doubles (Ranked): 45,591 players\n- Standard (Ranked): 30,900 players\n- Doubles: 26,083 players\n- Standard: 22,917 players\n\nThis suggests focusing on these modes for shorter queue times and more competitive matches.\n\nUnfortunately, the Tournaments tool returned an empty result for Europe, so I cannot provide information about upcoming tournaments in your region.\n\n## 2. Lost Ark Raid Requirements\n\nThe Lost Ark tool provided a comprehensive list of guardian raids with their raid levels and item level requirements:\n\n**Tier 1 (302-420 item level):**\n- Ur'nil: 302\n- Lumerus: 340\n- Icy Legoros: 380\n- Vertus: 420\n\n**Tier 2 (460-580 item level):**\n- Chromanius: 460\n- Nacrasena: 500\n- Flame Fox Yoho: 540\n- Tytalos: 580\n\n**Tier 3 (802-920 item level):**\n- Dark Legoros: 802\n- Helgaia: 840\n- Calventus: 880\n- Achates: 920\n\n**Tier 4 (960-1080 item level):**\n- Frost Helgaia: 960\n- Lava Chromanium: 1000\n- Levanos: 1040\n- Alberhastic: 1080\n\n**Tier 5 (1302-1385 item level):**\n- Armored Nacrasena: 1302\n- Igrexion: 1340\n- Night Fox Yoho: 1370\n- Velganos: 1385\n\n## 3. Hearthstone Card Details\n\nThe Hearthstone tool provided details for Frost Lich Jaina:\n- Mana Cost: 9\n- Health: 30\n- Armor: 5\n- Text: \"**Battlecry:** Summon a 3/6 Water Elemental. Your Elementals have **Lifesteal** this game.\"\n- Rarity: Legendary\n- Class: Mage\n- Type: Hero\n\nNote: The tool output was cut off, so some information might be missing. No general card search for mage deck was performed as requested.\n\n## 4. Batman Game Deals\n\nThe CheapShark tool found these Batman game deals (limited to 5 results):\n\n1. LEGO Batman - $2.29 (cheapest)\n2. LEGO Batman 2 - $3.29\n3. Batman: Arkham VR - $2.49\n4. LEGO Batman Trilogy - $4.99\n5. Batman: Arkham Knight - $3.29\n\nThe Stores Info tool provided a list of digital PC game stores, including active ones like Steam, GamersGate, GreenManGaming, GOG, Origin, and Humble Store. However, the output was cut off, so the complete list is not available.\n\n## 5. Pokemon Unite Stats for Azumarill\n\nThe Pokemon Unite tool provided detailed information about Azumarill:\n\n**Basic Info:**\n- Tier: B (Down)\n- Role: All-Rounder\n- Range: Melee\n- Difficulty: Novice\n- Damage Type: Physical\n\n**Special Ability:** Huge Power\n- When hitting only a single enemy, attacks are always critical hits (150% damage instead of 200%)\n- When hitting multiple enemies, attacks never critically hit\n\n**Recommended Builds:**\n1. Aqua Pulse Build\n   - Lane: Center Share / Path Damage\n   - Held Items: Attack Weight, Focus Band, Weakness Policy\n   - Battle Item: X Speed (Optional: Full Heal)\n   - Moves: Bubble \u2192 Tackle \u2192 Aqua Tail \u2192 Water Pulse\n\n2.

CSGO Match History\n\nThe CSGO matches tool returned recent match data, showing matches between teams like Sharks and RED Canids in the ESL Challenger League Season 49 South America. However, the output was cut off, limiting the analysis of competitive trends. The available data shows online matches with 1-0 scores, but without complete information, it's difficult to provide meaningful trend analysis.\n\n## 7. Game Critic Search\n\nThe OpenCritic API found several critics with names similar to \"Travis North\":\n\n1. Travis Northup (closest match, 0.25 distance)\n2. Travis Bruno (0.63 distance)\n3. Travis White (0.63 distance)\n4. Travis Huber (0.63 distance)\n5. Travis Amores (0.65 distance)\n\nAnd several others with lower match scores.

Also, that ice mage hero card from the popular digital card game - the one where the character becomes a lich - what were its exact abilities? I'm in the mood for some crime-fighting action games featuring that caped crusader, but I'm on a budget - where could I find the best deals? And which online stores should I be checking for price comparisons anyway? I've been meaning to try that water rabbit Pok\u00e9mon in that MOBA game - what builds do people recommend for it? Could you also pull up my recent competitive shooter match history?

The 20-sided die rolled an **8**, so you should plan for 8 rounds of gameplay this evening.\n\n## 2. Top-Rated Board Games from 2022\nI checked the OpenCritic API for top-rated games from 2022. While this tool primarily returned video games rather than traditional board games, it did provide some inspiration:\n\n- **Elden Ring** - Released February 25, 2022 with a top critic score of 95/100\n- **God of War Ragnar\u00f6k** - Released November 9, 2022 with a top critic score of 92/100\n\n*Note: The OpenCritic API returned incomplete data, showing only the beginning of the God of War entry and potentially missing other top games from 2022. Additionally, this tool focuses on video games rather than tabletop games.*\n\n## 3. Free Digital Games on Epic Games Store\nI checked the Epic Games Store for free games with tabletop-style gameplay. Currently available:\n\n- **Outliver: Tribulation** - A survival-horror game with souls-like elements inspired by African mythology\n\n*Note: The tool returned incomplete data, cutting off mid-description. There may be additional free games available that weren't fully displayed in the results.*\n\n## 4. Digital Strategy Game Deals\nI searched for deals on digital versions of popular strategy games:\n\n### Gloomhaven Deals:\n- **Gloomhaven** - $11.03 (Steam)\n- **Gloomhaven - Gold Edition** - $25.25\n- **Gloomhaven - Jaws of the Lion** - $11.33\n- **Gloomhaven - Jaws of the Lion Expansion** - $17.99\n\n### Terraforming Mars Deals:\n- **Terraforming Mars** - $7.20 (Steam)\n- **Terraforming Mars - Prelude** (DLC) - $4.89\n- **Terraforming Mars - Venus Next** (DLC) - $4.89\n- **Terraforming Mars Collection** - $22.78\n\n*Note: The tool returned partial results for both searches, potentially cutting off additional deals or information.*\n\n## Summary\nFor your game night, you'll be playing 8 rounds as determined by the dice roll. While I couldn't provide traditional board game recommendations from 2022 specifically, I found several digital deals on popular strategy games like Gloomhaven (starting at $11.03) and Terraforming Mars (starting at $7.20) that you could play online between in-person sessions.

However, several requested items were not successfully retrieved: the chess puzzle, free game giveaways, Pok\u00e9mon information (both Charizard/Pikachu and Unite characters), Witcher 3 reviews (only game titles were found), and Lost Ark raid information.

My nephew is obsessed with that fire-breathing dragon from the American Pok\u00e9mon listings - you know, the one on the original box art? Could you remind me what its stats are? I'm curious how active Rocket League is right now - are people still playing that car soccer game? For Lost Ark, I need a refresher on both the character options and those special ability enhancements everyone talks about. I'm also considering trying Pok\u00e9mon Unite but only want to see the first page of characters. My friend recommended some Batman games on sale - what are the most affordable options right now?

Catan Starting Resources (4 six-sided dice rolled 3 times)\nThe Dice Roll Simulator provided three sets of four dice rolls:\n- Roll 1: [1, 5, 6, 6] = 18\n- Roll 2: [1, 1, 2, 1] = 5\n- Roll 3: [5, 6, 1, 3] = 15\n\n## 2. Poker Tournament Cards\nThe Card Draw Simulator only drew a single card instead of the 5 you requested:\n- Card drawn: 10\u2666 (Ten of Diamonds)\n\n**Limitation:** The tool only provided 1 card instead of the 5 requested for your poker tournament.\n\n## 3. Chess Puzzle (1600 difficulty with 3 player moves)\nThe Chess Puzzles tool did not return any results. \n\n**Limitation:** No chess puzzle was retrieved despite the request for a 1600-rated puzzle with 3 player moves.\n\n## 4. D&D Custom Dice Rolls (2 ten-sided dice, 5 times)\nThe Custom Dice Roll Simulator provided five sets of two 10-sided dice rolls:\n- Roll 1: [8, 7] = 15\n- Roll 2: [9, 4] = 13\n- Roll 3: [3, 7] = 10\n- Roll 4: [10, 4] = 14\n- Roll 5: [10, 4] = 14\n\n## 5. Rocket League Tournaments in Europe\nThe Rocket League Tournaments tool returned an empty result.\n\n**Limitation:** No tournament information was retrieved for the European region.\n\n## 6. Lost Ark Raid Information (Level 3)\nThe Lost Ark raids tool successfully returned level 3 raids:\n- Dark Legoros (Item Level: 802)\n- Helgaia (Item Level: 840)\n- Calventus (Item Level: 880)\n- Achates (Item Level: 920)\n\n## 7.

Lost Ark Game Stats\nThe Lost Ark stats tool returned the following character stats:\n- Crit\n- Specialization\n- Domination\n- Swiftness\n- Endurance\n- Expertise\n\n## 9. CSGO Match Results\nThe CSGO matches tool did not return any results despite requesting 5 recent matches.\n\n**Limitation:** No CSGO match data was retrieved.\n\n## Summary\nI've successfully prepared materials for Catan dice rolls, D&D custom dice rolls, and comprehensive Lost Ark information (raids, classes, and stats). However, I was unable to provide complete information for poker cards (only 1 card instead of 5), chess puzzles (no data returned), Rocket League tournaments (no data returned), and CSGO match results (no data returned).

I've been hearing about The Witcher 3 and specifically want to check out reviews by Travis North. Lastly, for the board game we're playing afterward, could you roll 3 regular six-sided dice twice?",
    "hard_rewrite": "I'm planning a game night with friends this weekend. For our tabletop adventure, I need some fortune-telling results - specifically the kind where you'd roll those special numbered polyhedrons with the highest possible number being the same as the total number of letters in the alphabet, and I'd like to see the results of doing that twice with two polyhedrons, repeated three times. Also, could you find some interesting facts about playthings and recreational activities to entertain everyone between sessions? Oh, and my Canadian friend was mentioning something about complimentary digital entertainment currently being offered on that online platform created by the makers of Fortnite - what might they find there? For our online gaming portion, I'm curious what challenges await at the third difficulty tier of those monster hunts in that Korean MMORPG with sailing and island exploration. I'm also working on that card collection strategy game by Blizzard - specifically building a holy warrior deck and wondering about that spell card that references illumination in darkness. Could you also show me some of those creatures from that team-based arena game with the famous Japanese monsters? I've been hearing great things about that fantasy RPG with the white-haired monster hunter, and I'm particularly interested in what that reviewer Travis has said about it. Finally, for our board game finale, we'll need to know the outcome of tossing three of those common cubes with numbers 1-6, and we should do that twice."

I've been exploring that Korean MMO with all the islands too - what character options do they have again, and which islands have special items? Oh, and what about those underwater dungeons in that game? Also, I'm building a team for that Nintendo monster battling game - specifically looking for details on that blue rabbit-like water creature that evolves from a round mouse.

You play as a soldier trapped in a supernatural realm who must participate in an ancient ritual to escape.\n\n**Note**: The tool returned only partial information for the US region. The description was cut off mid-sentence, and there may be additional free games that weren't fully displayed in the results.\n\n### Germany Region\nFor the German (DE) region, I found:\n- **Brotato**: A top-down arena shooter roguelite where you play as a potato wielding up to 6 weapons simultaneously to fight alien hordes. The game features various traits and items to create unique builds.\n\n**Note**: Similar to the US results, the information for Germany was also incomplete, with the price details being cut off. There might be additional free games available that weren't fully displayed.\n\n## Travis North's Reviews\n\nI searched for Travis North's gaming reviews, but the closest match found was **Travis Northup** (with a 0.25 similarity score). The search also returned other reviewers with similar names:\n- Travis Bruno\n- Travis White\n- Travis Huber\n- Travis Amores\n- Travis Verbil\n- Travis LeFevre\n- Travis Huinker\n- Dale North\n- Travis Williams\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't retrieve any actual reviews from Travis Northup or any of these reviewers, as the tool only provided their names and IDs, not their actual gaming opinions or reviews.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your gaming weekend with friends from different countries, I've found that the Epic Games Store currently offers \"Outliver: Tribulation\" in the US and \"Brotato\" in Germany. However, the information is incomplete, and there might be more free games available in both regions. \n\nRegarding Travis North's reviews, I could only find a similar name (Travis Northup) but couldn't access any of his actual gaming opinions.

This could be due to an API error or timeout. You'll need to find this information through another source to assign characters to players.\n\n## 4. Lost Ark Islands with Dropped Items\nThe Lost Ark tool returned a partial list of islands with dropped items. However, the data appears to be incomplete as it was cut off. From what was returned:\n\n- Each island (unnamed in the data, all labeled as 'island') contains various items identified by numeric IDs\n- The data shows at least 20 different islands with their respective item drops\n- Each island has between 1-10+ different items that can be found\n- The quantities of each item vary significantly (from 1 to 10,000+ for some items)\n\nUnfortunately, the island names are generic ('island') rather than their actual in-game names, and the item IDs are not translated to item names, making this information difficult to use directly for treasure hunting planning.\n\n## Summary\nFor your gaming night: You'll play 8 rounds in your tabletop RPG session. However, I couldn't retrieve the chess puzzles or Pok\u00e9mon Unite character list due to tool errors. The Lost Ark islands information was incomplete and lacks proper naming, making it difficult to use for treasure hunting. I recommend finding alternative sources for the missing or incomplete information to ensure your gaming night is well-prepared.",

    "final_answer": "# Gaming Night Planning with Pok\u00e9mon and Tabletop Games\n\n## 1. UK Pok\u00e9dex Information\n\nI retrieved Pok\u00e9mon data from the UK Pok\u00e9dex, but the tool returned only partial results. The output shows only the first 7 Pok\u00e9mon (Bulbasaur through Squirtle), with the Squirtle entry being cut off mid-data. This is significantly limited compared to a complete Pok\u00e9dex which would contain hundreds of Pok\u00e9mon. Here's what was returned:\n\n| Number | Name | Type | Abilities | Weakness |\n|--------|------|------|-----------|----------|\n| 001 | Bulbasaur | grass, poison | Overgrow | Fire, Psychic, Flying, Ice |\n| 002 | Ivysaur | grass, poison | Overgrow | Fire, Psychic, Flying, Ice |\n| 003 | Venusaur | grass, poison | Overgrow | Fire, Psychic, Flying, Ice |\n| 004 | Charmander | fire | Blaze | Water, Ground, Rock |\n| 005 | Charmeleon | fire | Blaze | Water, Ground, Rock |\n| 006 | Charizard | fire, flying | Blaze | Water, Electric, Rock |\n| 007 | Squirtle | water | Torrent | Grass, Electric |\n\nFor a complete trivia game, you would need to obtain the full UK Pok\u00e9dex data, as this limited sample is insufficient.\n\n## 2. Blastoise in Pok\u00e9mon Unite\n\nI found detailed information about Blastoise in Pok\u00e9mon Unite, though the data was also partially cut off. Here's what I could gather:\n\n- **Tier**: B\n- **Range**: Ranged\n- **Difficulty**: Intermediate\n- **Role**: Defender\n- **Damage Type**: Special\n- **Evolution Path**: Squirtle (Level 5) \u2192 Wartortle (Level 9) \u2192 Blastoise\n- **Last Updated**: January 13, 2023\n\n**Recommended Builds**:\n1. **Spout Spin** (Center Damage)\n   - Held Items: Energy Amplifier, Sp. Atk Specs, Focus Band\n   - Battle Item: Eject Button\n   - Moves: Water Gun, Skull Bash \u2192 Water Spout, Rapid Spin\n\n2. **Surf Pump** (Path Tank)\n   - Held Items: Energy Amplifier, Buddy Barrier, Focus Band\n   - Battle Item: Eject Button\n   - Moves: Water Gun, Skull Bash \u2192 Hydro Pump, Surf\n\n3. **Spin Pump** (Path Tank)\n   - Held Items: Energy Amplifier, Muscle Band, Focus Band (Optional: Rapid Fire Scarf)\n   - Battle Item: Eject Button\n   - Moves: Water Gun, Skull Bash \u2192 Hydro Pump, Rapid Spin\n\n**Passive Ability**: Torrent - Increases Attack and Sp. Attack by 20% while at half HP or less.\n\nNote: The complete skill details were cut off in the tool output.\n\n## 3. Dice Roll Results\n\n### Custom 20-sided Dice (5 rolls)\nThe custom dice roll simulator successfully rolled five 20-sided dice with the following results:\n- Die 1: 11\n- Die 2: 12\n- Die 3: 2\n- Die 4: 1\n- Die 5: 12\n- Total: 38\n\nThese results can be used for your random Pok\u00e9mon selection in tournament brackets.\n\n### Regular Dice Rolls (3 dice, 4 times)\nThe regular dice roll simulator successfully rolled three standard dice four times:\n\n- Roll 1: [1, 2, 2] = 5\n- Roll 2: [6, 3, 2] = 11\n- Roll 3: [6, 6, 6] = 18 (Triple sixes!)\n- Roll 4: [6, 6, 2] = 14\n- Total across all rolls: 48\n\nThese results can be used for your random team assignments.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your gaming night, you now have:\n1. A partial list of UK Pok\u00e9dex Pok\u00e9mon (only 7 entries) - you'll need to obtain more data for a complete trivia game\n2. Detailed information about Blastoise in Pok\u00e9mon Unite, including three viable builds and strategy information\n3. Random number results from both custom 20-sided dice and regular dice rolls that you can use for tournament brackets and team assignments\n\nYou may want to seek additional Pok\u00e9dex data to complete your trivia game preparation.",

    "final_answer": "# Gaming Night Preparation\n\n## 1. Lost Ark Islands with Rare Items\n\nThe Lost Ark tool provided information about islands where rare items can be found, but the output was incomplete and cut off. From what was returned, we can see that each island contains various items identified by numeric IDs. Here's a partial list of the islands and their items:\n\n- Island 1: Items 133003, 510103, 889005, 889101\n- Island 2: Items 201201, 403003, 889102, 6830302\n- Island 3: Items 120308, 133001, 889103, 58003011\n\nAnd so on for at least 20 islands. Unfortunately, the actual island names are all listed as 'island' rather than their specific names, and the data was cut off mid-response, so this is only a partial list. Additionally, without item name translations, these numeric IDs aren't very helpful for planning your adventure.\n\n## 2. Latest Hearthstone Cards\n\nUnfortunately, the Hearthstone tool did not return any card information despite the request for the first 10 cards. The tool appears to have been called with the correct parameters (page 1, pageSize 10), but no data was returned. We cannot provide information on the latest Hearthstone cards for your tournament.\n\n## 3. Poker Night Card Draw\n\nThe Card Draw Simulator successfully drew 5 cards from a standard deck for your poker night:\n\n- 10 of Diamonds (10\u2666)\n- 2 of Hearts (2\u2665)\n- 8 of Spades (8\u2660)\n- King of Spades (K\u2660)\n- 9 of Hearts (9\u2665)\n\nThis hand contains no pairs or special combinations - it's a high card (King) hand in poker terms.\n\n## 4. UK Pok\u00e9dex for Trivia Competition\n\nThe Pok\u00e9dex tool returned the beginning of the UK Pok\u00e9dex, but the data was cut off. Here are the first 7 Pok\u00e9mon from the list:\n\n1. **Bulbasaur** (#001)\n   - Type: Grass, Poison\n   - Abilities: Overgrow\n   - Weakness: Fire, Psychic, Flying, Ice\n   - Height: 0.7m, Weight: 6.9kg\n\n2. **Ivysaur** (#002)\n   - Type: Grass, Poison\n   - Abilities: Overgrow\n   - Weakness: Fire, Psychic, Flying, Ice\n   - Height: 1m, Weight: 13kg\n\n3. **Venusaur** (#003)\n   - Type: Grass, Poison\n   - Abilities: Overgrow\n   - Weakness: Fire, Psychic, Flying, Ice\n   - Height: 2m, Weight: 100kg\n\n4. **Charmander** (#004)\n   - Type: Fire\n   - Abilities: Blaze\n   - Weakness: Water, Ground, Rock\n   - Height: 0.6m, Weight: 8.5kg\n\n5. **Charmeleon** (#005)\n   - Type: Fire\n   - Abilities: Blaze\n   - Weakness: Water, Ground, Rock\n   - Height: 1.1m, Weight: 19kg\n\n6. **Charizard** (#006)\n   - Type: Fire, Flying\n   - Abilities: Blaze\n   - Weakness: Water, Electric, Rock\n   - Height: 1.7m, Weight: 90.5kg\n\n7. **Squirtle** (#007)\n   - Type: Water\n   - Abilities: Torrent\n   - Weakness: Grass, Electric\n   - Height: 0.5m, Weight: 9kg\n\nThe data was cut off after Squirtle, so this is only a small portion of the complete UK Pok\u00e9dex.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've gathered some information for your gaming night, but unfortunately, most of the data is incomplete. The Lost Ark islands data lacks island names and item descriptions, the Hearthstone card information is completely missing, the poker card draw was successful, and the UK Pok\u00e9dex only provided the first 7 Pok\u00e9mon.

Additional tool calls would be needed to get detailed reviews for these games.\n\n3. **Dice Roll Results:**\n   I rolled 5 dice for you, resulting in: [6, 3, 4, 6, 1]\n   Total: 20\n   Based on your request, this means you should prepare for 20 card games for your gaming night.\n\n4. **Card Draw for Game Genre:**\n   The card drawn was: Ace of Spades (A\u2660)\n   According to your plan, this will determine which game genre you'll focus on first. You'll need to decide what the Ace of Spades represents in your genre selection system.\n\n5. **Lost Ark Island Items:**\n   The tool returned a list of islands with their dropped items, but the data is limited in two ways:\n   - The island names are all generically labeled as 'island' rather than their actual names\n   - The items are only identified by numeric IDs (like '133003', '510103') without descriptions\n   - The response was cut off, showing only 20 islands out of what appears to be a larger dataset\n   \n   This makes it difficult to provide meaningful information about what specific items can be found on which named islands for your friends who might join online later.\n\nIn summary, for your gaming night: You have a dice roll total of 20 for card game preparation, an Ace of Spades to determine your starting genre, and some partial information about God of War games.

    "final_answer": "# Gaming Weekend Planning Results\n\n## 1. Free Game Giveaways on Steam\n\nI attempted to retrieve free game giveaways on Steam sorted by popularity using the GamerPower tool, but unfortunately, the tool did not return any results. This could be due to a technical issue with the API or there might not be any active giveaways at the moment. I recommend checking Steam's store page directly or visiting GamerPower.com for the latest free game offers.\n\n## 2. Upcoming CSGO Matches\n\nThe CSGO matches tool was queried for upcoming matches, but no results were returned. This could be due to an API connection issue or there might not be any scheduled matches in the immediate future. For reliable information, I suggest checking HLTV.org or the official CS:GO esports page for upcoming matches to watch with your friends.\n\n## 3. UK Pok\u00e9mon List for Trivia Night\n\nThe Pokedex tool returned the beginning of a UK Pok\u00e9mon list, but the output was truncated. Here are the first 7 Pok\u00e9mon from the list:\n\n| Number | Name | Type | Abilities | Weaknesses |\n|--------|------|------|-----------|------------|\n| 001 | Bulbasaur | Grass, Poison | Overgrow | Fire, Psychic, Flying, Ice |\n| 002 | Ivysaur | Grass, Poison | Overgrow | Fire, Psychic, Flying, Ice |\n| 003 | Venusaur | Grass, Poison | Overgrow | Fire, Psychic, Flying, Ice |\n| 004 | Charmander | Fire | Blaze | Water, Ground, Rock |\n| 005 | Charmeleon | Fire | Blaze | Water, Ground, Rock |\n| 006 | Charizard | Fire, Flying | Blaze | Water, Electric, Rock |\n| 007 | Squirtle | Water | Torrent | Grass, Electric |\n\n**Note:** This is only a partial list showing the first 7 Pok\u00e9mon. The complete UK Pok\u00e9dex would include hundreds more Pok\u00e9mon. For a complete list, I recommend using the official Pok\u00e9mon website or a dedicated Pok\u00e9mon database.\n\n## 4. Poker Practice Card Draw\n\nThe Card Draw Simulator successfully drew 5 cards from a standard deck for your poker practice session:\n\n**Your 5-card draw:** 10\u2666, 2\u2665, 8\u2660, K\u2660, 9\u2665\n\nThis hand contains a King high with no pairs or special combinations.\n\n## 5. Custom Valorant Weapon Creation\n\nThe attempt to create a custom weapon for the 'WeekendWarriors' class in Valorant returned an error (HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error). This suggests that either:\n- The 'WeekendWarriors' weapon class doesn't exist in the system yet\n- There was a server-side issue with the weapon creation tool\n- The API may not support custom weapon creation for third-party classes\n\nFor custom Valorant content, you might want to explore community mods or official Valorant development tools if available.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your gaming weekend, I've provided a partial UK Pok\u00e9mon list for your trivia night and a 5-card draw for poker practice. Unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve information about free Steam games or upcoming CSGO matches due to tool limitations, and the Valorant weapon creation attempt was unsuccessful. I recommend checking official sources for the missing information to complete your gaming weekend plans.",

On another note, I'm working on completing my Pok\u00e9mon collection and need to see the complete UK Pokedex data.

This could mean there are no current news items about free items or events, or there might be an issue with the tool's data source. I cannot provide any information about Rocket League freebies or events at this time.\n\n## 3) Lost Ark Islands with Valuable Drops\n\nThe Lost Ark tool returned a list of islands with their dropped items, but with some limitations:\n\n- The data shows multiple islands, each simply named \"island\" without specific names\n- Each island has various item IDs and quantities, but no item names or descriptions\n- The output was cut off, so the complete list isn't available\n\nWithout proper island names and item descriptions, it's difficult to determine which drops are most valuable. The data shows item IDs like 889005, 510103, etc., but without context on what these items are.\n\n## 4) Free Games on Steam\n\nThe tools did not provide any information about free games currently available on Steam. None of the tools executed were designed to fetch this specific information.\n\n## 5) Random Game Selection System\n\nI've set up a random game selection system using dice rolls as requested:\n\n- First 3d8 roll: [8, 4, 6] = 18\n- Second 3d8 roll: [2, 5, 5] = 12\n- Total: 30\n\nAdditionally, I rolled a single d6 which resulted in: 3\n\nYou can use these random numbers to help select between the games you find. For example, you could assign numbers to different games and use these results to make your selection.\n\n## Summary\n\nI found several Batman games under $15, with prices ranging from $2.29 to $4.99. Unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve any Rocket League news, and the Lost Ark island data was incomplete and lacked specific island names and item descriptions. No information was provided about free Steam games. I successfully set up a random selection system with dice rolls that resulted in values of 18 and 12 for the 3d8 rolls, and 3 for a single d6 roll.",

I'm unable to provide you with the weekend match schedule you requested.\n\n## Lost Ark Abyssal Dungeons\nThe Lost Ark tool successfully provided information about abyssal dungeons, which is helpful for you as a new player:\n\n### Abyssal Dungeons by Item Level Requirement:\n1. **Ancient Elveria** (Item Level 340)\n   - Demon Beast Canyon\n   - Necromancer's Origin\n\n2. **Phantom Palace** (Item Level 460)\n   - Hall of the Twisted Warlord\n   - Hildebrandt Palace\n\n3. **Ark of Arrogance** (Item Level 840)\n   - Road of Lament\n   - Forge of Fallen Pride\n\n4. **Gate of Paradise** (Item Level 960)\n   - Sea of Indolence\n   - Tranquil Karkosa\n   - Alaric's Sanctuary\n\n5. **Oreha's Well** (Item Level 1325)\n   - Alirta's Oculus\n   - Oreha Preveza\n\nThis progression path shows you which dungeons to target as you increase your item level.\n\n## God of War Reviews\nThe OpenCritic search returned several God of War related games, but not the actual reviews. Here are the God of War titles found:\n\n- God of War (exact match)\n- God of War Ragnar\u00f6k\n- God of War III Remastered\n- God of Rock\n- God of Riffs\n\nHowever, no actual review scores or content was provided, so I cannot give you information about the game's reception.\n\n## Pok\u00e9mon List for Pok\u00e9dex\nThe Pok\u00e9dex tool returned the beginning of a Pok\u00e9mon list, but the data was cut off. Here are the first 7 Pok\u00e9mon that were returned:\n\n1. **Bulbasaur** (#001)\n   - Type: Grass/Poison\n   - Abilities: Overgrow\n   - Weaknesses: Fire, Psychic, Flying, Ice\n\n2. **Ivysaur** (#002)\n   - Type: Grass/Poison\n   - Abilities: Overgrow\n   - Weaknesses: Fire, Psychic, Flying, Ice\n\n3. **Venusaur** (#003)\n   - Type: Grass/Poison\n   - Abilities: Overgrow\n   - Weaknesses: Fire, Psychic, Flying, Ice\n\n4. **Charmander** (#004)\n   - Type: Fire\n   - Abilities: Blaze\n   - Weaknesses: Water, Ground, Rock\n\n5. **Charmeleon** (#005)\n   - Type: Fire\n   - Abilities: Blaze\n   - Weaknesses: Water, Ground, Rock\n\n6. **Charizard** (#006)\n   - Type: Fire/Flying\n   - Abilities: Blaze\n   - Weaknesses: Water, Electric, Rock\n\n7. **Squirtle** (#007)\n   - Type: Water\n   - Abilities: Torrent\n   - Weaknesses: Grass, Electric\n\nPlease note this is only the beginning of the Pok\u00e9dex and the data was truncated. A complete Pok\u00e9dex would contain hundreds more Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n## Valorant Weapon Creation\nThe attempt to create a new Valorant weapon in the 'testclass' category resulted in an error (HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error). This suggests that either the 'testclass' category doesn't exist as required by the tool, or there was a server-side issue with the request.\n\n# Conclusion\nI was only able to provide complete information about Lost Ark's abyssal dungeons and partial information about Pok\u00e9mon for your Pok\u00e9dex. Unfortunately, the tools didn't return data for free game giveaways, CS:GO matches, or God of War reviews, and the Valorant weapon creation attempt failed. To maximize your gaming options without spending much money, I'd recommend checking gaming platforms directly (Epic Games Store, Steam, PlayStation Store) for weekly free games, and visiting review aggregator sites like OpenCritic or Metacritic for God of War reviews.",

Pok\u00e9mon Unite Information\n\nUnfortunately, the Pok\u00e9mon Unite tool did not return any data. The tool was called with parameters to retrieve 5 Pok\u00e9mon from page 1, but no information was provided in the output.\n\n## 3. D&D 20-sided Dice Roll\n\nI rolled one 20-sided die for your D&D session:\n- Result: 8\n\n**Limitation:** Only one die was rolled instead of the three requested. You'll need to roll two more 20-sided dice for your D&D session.\n\n## 4. Regular Dice for Board Game Selection\n\nI rolled five regular (6-sided) dice for your board game selection:\n- Results: [6, 3, 4, 6, 1]\n- Total: 20\n\n## 5. Gambling Mini-Game Dice Simulation\n\nI simulated 3 sets of rolls with 4 dice each for your gambling mini-game:\n\nSet 1: [1, 5, 6, 6] = 18\nSet 2: [1, 1, 2, 1] = 5\nSet 3: [5, 6, 1, 3] = 15\n\nTotal across all sets: 38\n\n## 6. CS:GO Professional Matches\n\nUnfortunately, the CS:GO matches tool did not return any data. The tool was called with parameters to retrieve the latest 15 matches, but no information was provided in the output.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully prepared:\n- A list of active digital PC game stores to check for giveaways (though the list may be incomplete)\n- Dice rolls for your board game selection (5 dice)\n- Dice simulations for your gambling mini-game (3 sets of 4 dice)\n- One 20-sided die roll for D&D (though you requested three)\n\nHowever, I couldn't retrieve:\n- Information about 5 Pok\u00e9mon from Pok\u00e9mon Unite\n- The latest 15 CS:GO professional matches\n- Two additional 20-sided dice rolls for D&D",

For my tabletop gaming section, I need some probability examples - perhaps what happens when someone rolls one of those many-sided dice from D&D? And what about rolling a handful of regular dice at once? Or even better, what if someone rolled several dice multiple times in sequence?

This could be due to a technical issue with the API or limitations in the available puzzle database.\n\n## 4) Upcoming Rocket League Tournaments in Europe\nThe Rocket League Tournaments tool was queried for European tournaments, but it returned an empty result ({}). This suggests that either there are no upcoming tournaments scheduled in Europe at the moment, or the API might not have current tournament data available.\n\n## 5) Custom Valorant Weapon Creation\nThe attempt to create a custom Valorant weapon for your in-house tournament resulted in an error (HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error). This indicates a server-side issue with the Valorant Weapons API. Unfortunately, we couldn't create a custom weapon at this time.\n\n## 6) Dice Roll Results\nThe Dice Roll Simulator successfully rolled 5 dice once with the following results:\n- Die 1: 6\n- Die 2: 2\n- Die 3: 3\n- Die 4: 1\n- Die 5: 1\n- **Total**: 13\n\n## Summary\nFor your gaming weekend, I was able to provide detailed information about Lost Ark classes and raids to help you decide if you want to try it, and I successfully rolled 5 dice for your board game night (total: 13). Unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve information about Steam free game giveaways, chess puzzles with 1800 difficulty rating, or upcoming Rocket League tournaments in Europe. The attempt to create a custom Valorant weapon also failed due to a server error.",

On a different note, I've been working on my chess skills - any chance you could find me 10 middlegame advantage puzzles rated around 1800 that involve 3 player moves?

Also, that new MMO everyone's talking about - you know, the one with all those guardian boss fights - I'm curious what character options it offers before I commit. And since I'm trying to improve my strategic thinking, I could use some challenging board puzzles around the 1800 skill level that focus on positional advantages in the middle phase of play, with about 3 moves to solve. By the way, are there any competitive rocket-powered car soccer events happening across the Atlantic soon? Oh, and for game night tonight with friends, I need a quick way to generate some random numbers between 1-6, five times at once."

This suggests there are either no upcoming matches in the database or the data source might not be current. You may want to check official CS:GO tournament websites for the most up-to-date information.\n\n## 3) Rocket League Challenges\nThe Rocket League Challenges tool returned an empty object ({}), indicating no data was available for the weekly challenges you requested. This could be due to the API not being updated or other technical limitations. Consider checking the official Rocket League website or in-game for current challenges.\n\n## 4) Chess Puzzles\nThe Chess Puzzles tool didn't return any actual puzzle data despite the parameters being set for 1800-rated endgame tactical puzzles. The output appears to be empty or incomplete. You might need to try a different chess puzzle resource.\n\n## 5) Lost Ark Raids Information\nThe Lost Ark raids tool successfully returned information about Level 1 Guardian Raids:\n- **Ur'nil**: Item Level 302\n- **Lumerus**: Item Level 340\n- **Icy Legoros**: Item Level 380\n- **Vertus**: Item Level 420\n\nThese are the entry-level raids you could tackle if you decide to try Lost Ark.\n\n## 6) Lost Ark Character Stats\nThe Lost Ark stats tool provided the main character statistics in the game:\n- Crit\n- Specialization\n- Domination\n- Swiftness\n- Endurance\n- Expertise\n\nThese are the core stats you'll need to understand when building characters in Lost Ark.\n\n## 7) Hearthstone Card: A Light in the Darkness\nThe Hearthstone card tool successfully retrieved detailed information about the card:\n- **Name**: A Light in the Darkness\n- **Mana Cost**: 2\n- **Class**: Paladin\n- **Rarity**: Common\n- **Type**: Spell (Holy)\n- **Text**: \"Discover a minion.

The search returned outlets like 'Games Freezer' and 'Game Freaks 365', and games like 'Friday the 13th: The Game' and 'Football Game', but no actual free game giveaway information. To find current free games, you might want to check platforms like Epic Games Store, Steam, or GOG directly.\n\n## 2) Latest Rocket League News\nUnfortunately, the Rocket League Blog tool returned an empty result ({}), indicating either an error with the API or no recent blog posts available. I recommend checking the official Rocket League website or their social media channels for the latest news on special events.\n\n## 3) Upcoming CS:GO Tournaments\nThe CS:GO matches and tournaments tool did not return any data. This could be due to an API error or no upcoming tournaments in the database. For current tournament information, you might want to check HLTV.org or the official CS:GO channels.\n\n## 4) D&D Dice Roll Simulation\nThe Dice Roll Simulator successfully generated a 4d10 roll for your D&D session:\n- Individual dice results: [10, 1, 9, 1]\n- Total roll: 21\n\nYou can use this result for your D&D game this weekend.\n\n## 5) Critically Acclaimed Indie Games\nI searched for indie game developers using the OpenCritic API, but this only returned author names like 'Robert Dever Jr' and 'Cass Games' rather than recent indie game releases. The search did not provide information about critically acclaimed indie games released this month. Consider checking dedicated indie game websites or Steam's indie section for recent releases.\n\n## 6) Chess Puzzle Challenge\nThe Chess Puzzles tool did not return any data when attempting to retrieve puzzle ID 'HxxIU'. This could be due to an invalid puzzle ID or an API error. For chess puzzles, you might want to visit chess.com or lichess.org for a selection of daily puzzles.\n\n## 7) Hearthstone Card Details\nThe Hearthstone API successfully returned detailed information about 'A Light in the Darkness':\n\n- **Name**: A Light in the Darkness\n- **Mana Cost**: 2\n- **Type**: Spell (Holy)\n- **Class**: Paladin\n- **Rarity**: Common\n- **Effect**: Discover a minion. Give it +1/+1.\n- **Card Set**: Whispers of the Old Gods\n- **Flavor Text**: \"Wait, how can you have a light in the dark? If you turn on a light while it's dark, doesn't that mean it's no longer dark?\"\n\n## Summary\nFor your gaming weekend, I was able to provide a D&D dice roll (4d10) with a total of 21 and detailed information about the Hearthstone card 'A Light in the Darkness'. Unfortunately, several tools returned limited or no information regarding free game giveaways, Rocket League news, CS:GO tournaments, indie game releases, and chess puzzles.

Chess Puzzles\n\nUnfortunately, the Chess Puzzles tool did not return any results for the requested puzzle ID 'HxxIU'.

This could be due to an API error or no available tournament data at the moment. I cannot provide information about upcoming CSGO tournaments in Europe based on the tool results.\n\n## 2. Rocket League Information\nBoth the Rocket League Blog tool and the Rocket League Tournaments tool for Europe returned empty results ({}). This suggests either an API limitation or no current data available. Unfortunately, I cannot provide the latest blog posts or tournament schedules for Rocket League in Europe.\n\n## 3. Pok\u00e9mon Unite Characters\nThe Pok\u00e9mon Unite Pok\u00e9mons tool was executed but did not return any data. I cannot provide a list of Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Unite with their damage types based on the tool results.\n\n## 4.

Legend of Zelda Games with 'Majora' in the Title\nThe Legend of Zelda API returned an error message: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider\". I cannot provide information about Zelda games with 'Majora' in the title.\n\n## 6. Dice Roll Results\nThe dice roll simulators successfully returned random results:\n\n- Standard 6-sided die roll: **3**\n- Custom 8-sided die roll: **5**\n\nYou can use these random numbers for your tabletop gaming session.\n\n## 7. Free Games and Special Offers\nNo tool was executed to gather information about free games or special offers. I cannot provide information on this topic based on the tool results.\n\n## Summary\nFor your gaming weekend, I was able to provide information about Lost Ark level 3 raids and random dice roll results for your tabletop session. Unfortunately, the other tools either returned errors or empty results, so I cannot provide information about CSGO tournaments, Rocket League blog posts and tournaments, Pok\u00e9mon Unite characters, Legend of Zelda games with 'Majora' in the title, or free games and special offers.

However, the specific card lookup for \"A Light in the Darkness\" returned detailed information:\n\n- **Name**: A Light in the Darkness\n- **Mana Cost**: 2\n- **Type**: Spell (Holy)\n- **Class**: Paladin\n- **Rarity**: Common\n- **Text**: \"Discover a minion. Give it +1/+1.\"\n- **Set**: Whispers of the Old Gods\n\n## 5) Lost Ark Character Stats\n\nThe Lost Ark API returned the following character stats that can help with your character builds:\n\n- Crit\n- Specialization\n- Domination\n- Swiftness\n- Endurance\n- Expertise\n\n## 6) OpenCritic Game Reviews\n\nThe OpenCritic General Search for \"top rated games 2023\" returned primarily outlets rather than specific games. Only one game was found:\n\n- **Winter Games 2023** (match score: 0.607)\n\nThe rest of the results were gaming outlets like Raised By Games, games(TM), GAMES.CH, etc., rather than actual game reviews or ratings. This search did not provide useful information about top-rated games.\n\n## 7) Free-to-Play Games\n\nNone of the tools provided information about free-to-play games.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your gaming weekend, I've gathered information on Batman game deals (with prices ranging from $2.29 to $4.99) and provided custom dice roll results for your D&D campaign. I've also included details on one Hearthstone card and the main character stats in Lost Ark. Unfortunately, several requests were incomplete or unsuccessful: the gaming trivia questions returned an error, the Hearthstone general card search returned no results, the OpenCritic search didn't provide useful game reviews, and no information was found about free-to-play games.",

Upcoming CSGO Matches\n\nThe CSGO matches tool did not return any data. It appears there was an issue retrieving upcoming match information.\n\n## 3. Latest Rocket League News\n\nThe Rocket League News tool returned an empty object ({}), indicating that no news articles were retrieved or there was an issue with the tool.\n\n## 4. Digital Game Stores for Deals\n\nThe CheapShark Game Deals tool provided a list of digital PC game stores where you can find deals:\n\n**Active Stores:**\n- Steam (ID: 1)\n- GamersGate (ID: 2)\n- GreenManGaming (ID: 3)\n- GOG (ID: 7)\n- Origin (ID: 8)\n- Humble Store (ID: 11)\n\n**Inactive Stores:**\n- Amazon (ID: 4)\n- GameStop (ID: 5)\n- Direct2Drive (ID: 6)\n- Get Games (ID: 9)\n- Shiny Loot (ID: 10)\n- Desura (ID: 12)\n\n*Note: The response was cut off after Desura, so there may be additional stores not shown in the results.*\n\n## 5. Lost Ark Classes and Engravings\n\n### Classes and Subclasses:\n- **Warrior**: Berserker, Paladin, Gunlancer\n- **Martial Artist**: Striker, Wardancer, Scrapper, Soulfist\n- **Gunner**: Gunslinger, Artillerist, Deadeye, Sharpshooter\n- **Mage**: Bard, Sorceress\n- **Assassin**: Shadowhunter, Deathblade\n\n### Engravings:\nThe tool returned 42 engravings including Grudge, Cursed Doll, Adrenaline, Keen Blunt Weapon, and many others. Some notable engravings include:\n- Grudge\n- Spirit Absorption\n- Super Charge\n- Keen Blunt Weapon\n- Cursed Doll\n- Raid Captain\n- Awakening\n- Hit Master\n- Adrenaline\n- Precision Dagger\n\n## 6. Card Draw Results\n\nThe Card Draw Simulator drew 10 cards from a standard deck, all spades:\n4\u2660, 6\u2660, 9\u2660, Q\u2660, A\u2660, 5\u2660, 10\u2660, 7\u2660, 3\u2660, 8\u2660\n\n## 7. Dice Roll Results\n\n### Regular Dice (3 dice):\n- Results: [6, 5, 1]\n- Total: 12\n\n### 20-sided Die:\n- Result: 8\n\n## 8. Valorant Weapon Creation\n\nThe attempt to create a new Valorant weapon in the \"testclass\" class returned an error (HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error). This suggests either the test class doesn't exist or there was a server-side issue.\n\n## 9. Lost Ark Raids\n\nNo tool was executed to retrieve information about Lost Ark raids, so this information is missing from the results.\n\n## 10. Lost Ark 'Grudge' Engraving Details\n\nWhile the tool returned a list of available engravings (including Grudge), it did not provide specific details about the Grudge engraving itself.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've provided information on free-to-play MMORPGs with PvP elements, digital game stores for deals, Lost Ark classes and engravings, card draws for your card game night, and dice rolls for your D&D session. However, there were several gaps in the information: no CSGO match data, no Rocket League news, an error when creating a Valorant weapon, no Lost Ark raid information, and no specific details about the Grudge engraving.

Each island has different item IDs and quantities. The response was also truncated, showing only the first 20 islands out of what appears to be a larger dataset.\n\n*Note: The actual island names are missing, and item IDs are shown instead of item names, limiting the usefulness of this information.*\n\n## Zelda Games with 'Majora' in the Title\nThe Zelda API was unreachable, returning an error message: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\" Therefore, I couldn't retrieve information about Zelda games with 'Majora' in the title.\n\n## Pok\u00e9mon Information (UK Region)\nThe Pokedex API returned the beginning of the UK Pokedex, including:\n\n1. **Bulbasaur** (#001)\n   - Type: Grass, Poison\n   - Height: 0.7m, Weight: 6.9kg\n   - Ability: Overgrow\n   - Weaknesses: Fire, Psychic, Flying, Ice\n\n2. **Ivysaur** (#002)\n3. **Venusaur** (#003)\n4. **Charmander** (#004)\n5. **Charmeleon** (#005)\n6. **Charizard** (#006)\n7. **Squirtle** (#007)\n\n*Note: The response was truncated, showing only the first 7 Pok\u00e9mon out of the complete Pokedex.*\n\n## Dice Roll Results\n\n### Standard Dice Rolls (4d6 rolled 3 times)\nResults:\n- Roll 1: [1, 5, 6, 6] = 18\n- Roll 2: [1, 1, 2, 1] = 5\n- Roll 3: [5, 6, 1, 3] = 15\n- Total: 38\n\n### Custom Dice Rolls (2d20 rolled 3 times)\nResults:\n- Roll 1: [16, 3] = 19\n- Roll 2: [18, 7] = 25\n- Roll 3: [8, 18] = 26\n- Total: 70\n\n## Summary\nI've gathered most of the information you requested for your gaming weekend. Unfortunately, some data was incomplete or unavailable: the chess puzzles didn't return results, the Zelda API was unreachable, the Pok\u00e9mon list was truncated, and the Lost Ark island information lacked proper names.
