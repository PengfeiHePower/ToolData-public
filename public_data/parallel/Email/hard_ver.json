The tool returned only one email address: support@rapidapi.com. This appears to be a generic support email from RapidAPI (the platform hosting the tool) rather than an actual contact from acme-widgets.com. This suggests the tool may have failed to properly access or parse the website content, or the website doesn't contain publicly visible email addresses.\n\n## Domain Verification Results\n\n### mailinator.com Domain Check\nWhen attempting to verify if mailinator.com is a disposable domain, the tool returned an error: \"Service Suspended\". I cannot definitively confirm its status, but I can inform you that mailinator.com is indeed a well-known disposable email service that provides temporary email addresses. Users likely meant to use a legitimate business email instead.\n\n### gmial.com Domain Check\nThe domain verification tool returned \"Not Found\" for gmial.com. This domain appears to be a typo of gmail.com (note the transposed 'i' and 'a'). It's likely that the intended domain was gmail.com, which is Google's legitimate email service.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n1. The email extraction appears to have failed to return actual contacts from acme-widgets.com\n2. Any communications to mailinator.com addresses should be avoided as they are temporary and not suitable for business communications\n3. Emails with gmial.com are likely typos and messages sent to these addresses may not reach the intended recipients\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. Manually check the acme-widgets.com website for contact information or use an alternative tool\n2. For any mailinator.com addresses in your records, flag them as disposable and seek alternative contact methods\n3. For any gmial.com addresses, correct them to gmail.com after confirming with the contact\n4. Consider quarantining any communications with these problematic domains until proper contact information is established"

This is likely an error in the tool's response. I cannot confirm if info@mailinator.org is usable based on this data.\n\n**john.doe@tempmail.net**\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool indicates this is NOT a disposable email address, contrary to what the domain name might suggest. The tool reports {'disposable': False}, meaning this appears to be a legitimate email that doesn't expire quickly. However, I recommend additional verification as 'tempmail' in the domain name typically suggests a temporary email service.\n\n**mybusiness.org**\nThe fast Email verifier tool returned 'Not Found' when checking if mybusiness.org is a disposable domain. This means the tool couldn't determine if it's a burner domain or provide suggested alternatives. Additional verification would be needed.\n\n**sarah.smith@gmail.com**\nThe Email Existence Validator confirmed this Gmail address has proper MX records in place. The domain has multiple valid MX records pointing to Google's mail servers, which is expected for a functioning Gmail address. This suggests the email infrastructure is correctly set up to receive mail. However, this only verifies the domain's mail capability, not the specific user account.\n\n**Additional information requested but not available:**\n- No tool provided information about whether any address is a team/role inbox\n- The role account check for acmetech.com returned 'Not Found'\n- No specific risk assessment was provided for any of the addresses\n\nI recommend additional verification for info@mailinator.org since the tool returned incorrect data, and further investigation of mybusiness.org since no conclusive information was provided."

This is a tool limitation/error that needs investigation before we can confirm if john.doe@gmail.com is valid.\n\n3. **Role Account for acme-corp.com**: The tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking for role accounts associated with this domain. We lack information on whether any team/role inboxes exist for this domain.\n\n4. **contact@missingdomain123.com**: This email cannot receive mail. The MX record check confirmed \"No MX Found\" and that the domain does not exist. This address will swallow deliveries and should be removed or corrected.\n\n5. **yahoo.com Domain**: Yes, it's available (though this contradicts common knowledge as Yahoo is a major email provider - the tool result may be incorrect).\n\n6. **ourpartner.biz Domain**: The tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if this is a disposable domain. We cannot determine if it's a burner domain or suggest alternatives based on the available information.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Quarantine contact@missingdomain123.com as the domain doesn't exist\n- Verify john.doe@gmail.com again as the tool returned incorrect data\n- Double-check the yahoo.com availability result as it appears suspicious"

I recommend flagging this address for removal.\n\n## admin@mailinator.com\nEmail Existence Validator clearly identified admin@mailinator.com as a **disposable email address**. Mailinator is a well-known public inbox service where emails can be viewed by anyone. This should definitely be removed from your campaign list as it's designed for one-time use.\n\n## ceo@acmecorp.com\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned unusual results for this address. Instead of verifying ceo@acmecorp.com, it returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com, which appears to be an error or API limitation. **No valid verification was performed** for your requested address.\n\n## info@gmail.com\nEasy Email Validation confirms that info@gmail.com is a **valid email address** with proper MX records. However, I should note that this is likely a heavily trafficked address at Google, and may not be ideal for targeted communications. While technically valid, response rates may be extremely low.\n\n## Campaign Recommendations\n\n**Keep in campaign:**\n- contact@ourpartner.net (valid business contact)\n- support@tempmail.org (surprisingly not disposable)\n\n**Remove from campaign:**\n- help@besttempmail.com (likely temporary mail service)\n- admin@mailinator.com (confirmed disposable address)\n\n**Needs further verification:**\n- ceo@acmecorp.com (verification failed)\n\n**Consider alternatives:**\n- info@gmail.com (valid but likely high-volume generic address)"

The domain appears to be a typo of 'gmail.com' (note the misspelling 'gmial'), which suggests this is likely an invalid address that would bounce. I recommend correcting to john.doe@gmail.com.\n\n2. **info@acme-corp.com**: This email passed validation. The Email Validation tool confirmed it's not disposable and identified it as a role account (typically used for departments rather than individuals). The domain acme-corp.com appears legitimate. This is a sensible, usable contact, though being a role account means it's likely managed by a team rather than an individual.\n\n3. **contact@10minutemail.org**: The Blaze Verify tool returned unexpected results for this address. Instead of validating the provided email, it returned information for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com' which appears to be a sample response from the API. Based on the domain name '10minutemail.org', this is very likely a disposable email service designed for temporary use. I recommend flagging this as a potential throwaway address.\n\n4. **support@tempmail.org**: The Alpha Email Verification tool indicated this is NOT a disposable email, which is surprising given the domain name suggests a temporary mail service. However, without additional verification, I can only report what the tool returned. I would still recommend caution with this address as the domain name strongly suggests a temporary email service despite the tool's result.\n\n5. **ceo@startup-ventures.net**: The Email Existence Validator found no MX records for this domain, which means the domain is not configured to receive email. This address will not receive mail and would result in bounces. I recommend removing this from your contact list.\n\n6. **freeemail.co**: The fast Email verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if this is a disposable domain. The domain name has three 'e's which appears suspicious and could be a typo of 'freeemail.com' or 'freemail.com'. This could be a burner domain or simply a typo. I recommend verifying the intended domain with the contact.\n\nOverall, only info@acme-corp.com appears to be a fully valid and usable contact from your list.

However, based on the domain name '10minutemail.net', this is almost certainly a disposable email service designed for temporary use. These services typically delete emails after a short period (10 minutes in this case). This should be flagged for quarantine.\n\n### companyxyz.com\nThe fast Email verifier tool returned 'Not Found' when checking this domain. This suggests the domain may not exist or may be improperly configured. If this was intended to be a legitimate company domain, the user likely meant a more established domain like 'companyxyz.com' if that's a real company, or perhaps they intended a common domain like 'company.com'.\n\n### support@tempmail.org\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool indicates this is **NOT** a disposable email (returned 'disposable: False'). However, this result is suspicious given that 'tempmail.org' strongly suggests a temporary email service by its name. Consider additional verification before trusting this result.\n\n### marketing@mailinator.com\nThe Email Existence Validator confirmed this is a **disposable email** (returned 'disposable: True'). Mailinator is a well-known public email service where anyone can access inboxes without passwords. This should be flagged and removed from your contact list.\n\n### sarah.wilson@yahoo.com\n**INCONCLUSIVE**: The Email Validation tool returned a subscription error ('You are not subscribed to this API'). Yahoo is a legitimate email provider, but we couldn't verify this specific address. Generally, yahoo.com addresses are proper consumer email accounts.\n\n### ceo@microsoft.com\nThe Email Existence Validator successfully retrieved MX records for microsoft.com, confirming the domain has proper mail exchange servers (microsoft-com.mail.protection.outlook.com with priority 10). This suggests the domain can receive email, though we couldn't verify if this specific address exists or if it's monitored.\n\n### example.org\n**INCONCLUSIVE**: The fast Email verifier FreeDomain tool returned a 'Service Suspended' error. We couldn't determine if example.org is available or taken.\n\n### john.doe@gmail.com\n**CAUTION**: The Blaze Verify tool returned information for a completely different email (jarrett@blazeverify.com) rather than the requested john.doe@gmail.com. This appears to be a tool error or limitation. Gmail is a legitimate email provider, but we couldn't verify this specific address.\n\n## Summary\n- **Confirmed disposable**: marketing@mailinator.com\n- **Likely disposable**: contact@10minutemail.net\n- **Suspicious result**: support@tempmail.org (tool says not disposable but domain name suggests otherwise)\n- **Inconclusive but legitimate domains**: sarah.wilson@yahoo.com, ceo@microsoft.com\n- **Tool errors**: john.doe@gmail.com (wrong email returned), example.org (service suspended)\n- **Domain issue**: companyxyz.com (not found)"

However, mailinator.com is indeed a well-known burner/disposable email service.

This contradicts what might be expected from the domain name, but according to our verification tool, it appears to be a legitimate domain.\n\n2. **info@mycompany.com**: Email Existence Validator reports \"No MX Found\" for this domain. This means the domain doesn't have mail exchange records configured, so this address cannot receive emails. This needs to be fixed if you want to use it as a contact point.\n\n3. **mailinator.com**: The verification tool returned a \"Service Suspended\" error, so I couldn't verify if this is a burner domain. However, mailinator.com is widely known as a public disposable email service, so it should be treated as a burner domain. Users likely meant to use a legitimate email service instead.\n\n4. **john.doe@gmail.com**: The Blaze Verify tool actually returned results for a different email (jarrett@blazeverify.com), which appears to be a sample or default response. This means we don't have verification for the actual address you requested. A proper verification would be needed.\n\n5. **sales@disposable.com**: Email Existence Validator reports this is NOT a disposable email address, despite what the domain name suggests. However, the verification date shown (September 2025) is in the future, which raises questions about the reliability of this result.\n\n6. **webmaster@domain.net**: The verification tool returned an error (\"API doesn't exist\"), so I couldn't verify this address.\n\n7. **newsletter@freemail.com**: The verification tool returned a subscription error message, so I couldn't verify this address.\n\n8. **yahoo.com**: The domain is available according to the FreeDomain check, which states \"yahoo.com is a Free domain.\" This is likely incorrect as yahoo.com is definitely a registered domain owned by Yahoo.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Fix info@mycompany.com by setting up proper MX records\n- Treat mailinator.com addresses as disposable/burner emails\n- Several verification attempts failed or returned questionable results, so additional verification is recommended for most of these addresses"

Additionally, I don't see any data related to your request to \"surface wins/losses\" for quick decision-making. I recommend attempting validation again with properly configured tools or using an alternative email validation service."

Public Contact Emails from techcompetitor.com**\nI used the 'Get emails from url' tool to scan techcompetitor.com, but the results are limited. The tool only returned one email address: support@rapidapi.com. This appears to be the API provider's support email rather than actual contact information from techcompetitor.com. This suggests either the website doesn't publicly display email addresses or the tool was unable to properly scrape the site's content. You may need to manually review the website or use a different approach to find legitimate contact information.\n\n**2. Verification of marketing@potentialclient.com**\nThe email verification tool returned unexpected results. Instead of verifying marketing@potentialclient.com, it returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com:\n- Email: jarrett@blazeverify.com\n- State: deliverable\n- Score: 100 (highly deliverable)\n- Domain: blazeverify.com\n- SMTP Provider: Google\n\nThis appears to be an error or limitation with the verification tool, possibly showing the API provider's contact instead of verifying your requested email. I cannot confirm if marketing@potentialclient.com is valid based on these results.\n\n**3. Assessment of techsolutions.org**\nI attempted to check if techsolutions.org is a disposable domain using the 'Email verifier' tool, but received a 'Not Found' response. This doesn't necessarily mean it's a burner domain - it may simply indicate the domain isn't in the tool's database. Without additional information, I cannot definitively determine if this is a legitimate or disposable domain.\n\n**4. Surface wins/losses**\nNone of the tools provided information about wins or losses, so I cannot provide the thumbs-up/down assessment you requested.\n\nIn summary, the tools provided limited or potentially misleading information. I recommend:\n1. Manually reviewing techcompetitor.com for contact information\n2. Using a different email verification service for marketing@potentialclient.com\n3. Conducting additional research on techsolutions.org through domain registration lookups\n4. Seeking internal data sources for the wins/losses information"

However, the tool didn't specifically verify if the 'info@' address itself is active.\n\n4. **Mailchimp public contacts**: The 'Get emails from url' tool only returned 'support@rapidapi.com' from the Mailchimp website, which appears to be incorrect as this is not a Mailchimp contact. Failed to retrieve actual Mailchimp contact information.\n\n5. **gmail.com availability**: No - gmail.com is already taken. The Fast Email verifier tool reported it as \"a Free domain\".\n\nAdditional notes:\n- Several tools returned unrelated information (fake email generation, temporary email creation)\n- The role account check was run on 'mycompany.com' rather than any of the requested domains\n\nOverall, this triage was largely unsuccessful due to tool errors and mismatched responses."

The Email Existence Validator tool explicitly identified it as disposable (disposable: True). Don't waste time pursuing this contact.\n\n2. **techprofessionals.org domain**: Multiple verification attempts returned \"Not Found\" results, suggesting this may be a non-functional or very new domain. The domain verification tool couldn't find information about whether it's disposable.\n\n3. **Role inbox checks**: The role account verification for techprofessionals.org returned \"Not Found,\" so we couldn't determine if these are team/role inboxes.\n\n4. **info@techprofessionals.org mail reception**: The MX Records check revealed \"No MX Found\" for techprofessionals.org, meaning this domain doesn't have mail exchange servers configured. Emails sent to any address at this domain (including info@) will not be delivered.\n\n5. **techcompetitor.com contact emails**: Only one email was found: support@rapidapi.com. Note: This appears to be the API provider's email rather than an actual contact from the competitor's site, suggesting the tool may have limitations in extracting emails.\n\n6. **marketing@techprofessionals.org verification**: The Email Address Validator tool returned an error (\"API doesn't exist\"), so we couldn't verify this address.\n\n7. **director@techprofessionals.org verification**: The Email Validation tool returned a subscription error message, so we couldn't verify this address.\n\nIn summary: Don't pursue newsletter@disposableinbox.com as it's definitely disposable. The techprofessionals.org domain appears to be non-functional for email (no MX records), so none of those addresses will work. The only email extracted from techcompetitor.com was likely not relevant (support@rapidapi.com)."

The result came back as \"Not Found,\" which means this domain wasn't in their database of known disposable email providers. However, this doesn't definitively confirm it's a legitimate domain either.\n\n2. **Email Address Validation (user123@tempmail.io)**: I tried to validate the specific email address using the Email Validation tool, but encountered an error: \"You are not subscribed to this API.\" Unfortunately, I couldn't verify if this is a proper, usable contact.\n\n3. **Contact Emails from temporaryemailservices.org**: I extracted public contact emails from the website you specified. Only one email was found: 'support@rapidapi.com'. This is actually the support email for RapidAPI (the platform hosting these tools) rather than contact information for temporary email services.\n\nBased on the name 'tempmail.io' and your context about \"burner domains,\" this appears to be a temporary email service, though I couldn't definitively confirm this with the tools. The domain name strongly suggests it's a disposable email provider (\"temp\" + \"mail\").\n\n**Recommendation**: I suggest treating user123@tempmail.io as potentially risky since temporary email addresses are commonly used to circumvent verification systems. Consider requesting a corporate or more permanent email address instead. If you need to reach temporary email service administrators, the extracted contact (support@rapidapi.com) is not helpful as it's just the API platform's support."

I'd recommend not pursuing this contact method as you'd likely be 'chasing ghosts' as you mentioned.\n\n**2. Contact Information from example.com**\n\nThe email extraction tool found no email addresses on https://example.com/contact. This means:\n- The page either doesn't contain any email addresses\n- The page might use contact forms instead of displaying email addresses\n- The page could be using image-based or JavaScript-obfuscated emails that the tool couldn't detect\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. Don't use privacyuser@gettempmail.com for important communications as it's a disposable address\n2. Consider manually checking the example.com website for alternative contact methods (forms, phone numbers)\n3. If you must reach the website owners, consider using WHOIS lookup services or LinkedIn to find legitimate contacts\n\nThis appears to be a risky communication channel that could lead to another bounce. I'd recommend quarantining this approach and instead trying to establish contact through more official channels."

The domain check confirms gmail.com is a free domain (already taken/in use).\n\n3. **test123@yopmail.com**: Yes, this is a disposable email address. The Email Existence Validator explicitly confirmed it's a temporary address (disposable: True). Don't chase this contact.\n\n4. **Mailinator contacts**: The email scraper only found support@rapidapi.com from the Mailinator contact page, which appears to be the RapidAPI support email rather than Mailinator's actual contact. This result is likely misleading as it's probably pulling the API provider's contact instead of Mailinator's.\n\n**Risk assessment**: The yopmail address should be quarantined as it's confirmed disposable. For proper CRM hygiene, I'd suggest implementing email domain verification at entry points and flagging/segregating accounts with known disposable domains."

This suggests either the tool failed or there's no role account information available for this domain. This check is inconclusive.\n\n2. **example@outlook.com Mail Reception**: The Email Existence Validator found valid MX records for outlook.com (outlook-com.olc.protection.outlook.com with priority 5), indicating the domain is properly configured to receive email. However, this only confirms domain-level mail handling capability, not whether the specific address example@outlook.com accepts mail or silently discards it. Additional verification would be needed.\n\n3. **mailinator.com Availability**: The FreeDomain tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking mailinator.com. This likely indicates the tool failed rather than providing domain availability information, as mailinator.com is a well-known existing service. This check is inconclusive.\n\n4. **tempmail.org Burner Domain**: The disposable Domain tool returned a service suspension message rather than actual results. I cannot confirm if tempmail.org is a burner domain based on this error.\n\n5. **test@gmail.com Assessment**: The Email Checker tool confirmed test@gmail.com is NOT a disposable email (returned {\"disposable\": false}). This is a legitimate Gmail address, though being a simple 'test' username, it could still be risky as it's likely to receive significant spam or be used by multiple people for testing.\n\nMost of the tools returned limited or error responses, making a comprehensive risk assessment difficult. I recommend proceeding with caution and potentially using alternative verification methods before your warmup throttles kick in."

Here are the findings:\n\n1. **Email Creation Check**: The GetTempMail tool successfully created/accessed privacy_test@gettempmail.com, confirming the address exists in their system.\n\n2. **Disposable Email Status**: The Alpha Email Verification tool clearly identified this as a disposable email address (returned {'disposable': True}). This is a significant red flag for your list quality.\n\n3. **MX Record Verification**: The Email Existence Validator confirmed valid MX records for gettempmail.com, showing the domain has proper mail server configuration (mail.gettempmail.com with priority 0). This indicates the domain is set up to receive email, recorded as of August 20, 2025.\n\n4. **SMTP Functionality**: The fast Email verifier returned 'Not Found' when checking SMTP configuration, suggesting potential delivery issues.\n\n5. **Tool Limitations**: Several tools returned errors or inconsistent results:\n   - Email Validation_v3 returned a subscription error\n   - Email Address Validator returned 'API doesn't exist'\n   - Blaze Verify returned information for a completely different email (jarrett@blazeverify.com) rather than the requested address\n\n**Summary**: privacy_test@gettempmail.com is definitively a disposable/temporary email address with functioning MX records but questionable delivery capability. I recommend quarantining this address immediately as it presents a high risk for your budget-sensitive communications. Disposable emails like this are typically used to avoid accountability or for one-time interactions, making them inappropriate for important business communications. The fix would be to require contacts to provide permanent, corporate email addresses for your list."

The validator found it fails MX record checks (\"MX record not found\") and SMTP validation, meaning this address cannot receive emails.\n\n4. tempmail.org check: The disposable domain check returned a service suspension message rather than actual results. Cannot confirm if it's a burner domain.\n\n5. user@protonmail.com verification: The tool successfully retrieved MX records for this address (mail.protonmail.ch and mailsec.protonmail.ch), indicating the domain is properly configured to receive mail.

Email Validity: The address secure_signup@gettempmail.com appears to exist in the system as it has valid MX records pointing to mail.gettempmail.com, but multiple verification attempts returned mixed or incomplete results.\n\n3. Deliverability Concerns: The SMTP check for this address returned 'Not Found', suggesting potential delivery issues. Messages sent to this address may not be reliably received.\n\n4. Role Account Check: The check for whether this is a team/role inbox returned 'Not Found', so we cannot confirm if it's a shared inbox.\n\n5. Domain Availability: For businessdomain.com - the availability check returned 'Not Found', so we cannot definitively say if it's available or taken.\n\nIn summary: secure_signup@gettempmail.com is definitely a disposable email address that shouldn't be trusted for important communications. I recommend not pursuing this contact as it's likely a throwaway address that won't be monitored long-term."

This suggests the tool may have redirected the verification or returned incorrect data. The verification shows:\n- State: Deliverable\n- Disposable: No\n- Score: 100\nHowever, since the email address in the results doesn't match what we queried, I cannot confirm if support@rapidapi.com is valid.\n\n2. **marketing@disposable-temp.com**:\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool reports:\n- Disposable: No\nDespite the domain name suggesting it might be temporary, the verification tool indicates it's not a disposable email address. This contradicts what the domain name implies, so I'd recommend additional verification.\n\n3. **ceo@gettempmail.com**:\nThe Email Existence Validator clearly identified this as:\n- Disposable: Yes\nThis confirms it's a temporary email address and should be flagged as you suggested. I recommend removing this from your contact list as it's likely a throwaway address.\n\n4. **info@example.com**:\nThe Email Existence Validator returned MX records that are problematic:\n- MX: [[0, '.']]\nThis unusual MX record (just a dot) indicates this domain isn't properly configured to receive email. The example.com domain is reserved for documentation purposes and doesn't actually process mail. This address should be removed from your list.\n\n5. **Additional Information**:\nThe Email Existence Validator Help Page shows they primarily support verification for major email providers like gmail.com, outlook.com, yahoo.com, etc. The example.com domain is not on their supported list.\n\nRecommended actions:\n- Quarantine ceo@gettempmail.com as it's confirmed disposable\n- Remove info@example.com as it cannot receive mail\n- Re-verify support@rapidapi.com with another tool as we got inconsistent results\n- Further investigate marketing@disposable-temp.com as the domain name suggests it might be temporary despite the tool result"

Without verification data, I cannot provide a proper security pass for this contact. This address requires additional verification before use.\n\n### support@rapidapi.com\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned unexpected results when checking this address. Instead of verifying support@rapidapi.com, it returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com, which appears to be a deliverable address (not disposable, score: 100). This tool malfunction means we don't have proper verification for support@rapidapi.com.\n\n### info@tempmail.org\nThe Easy Email Validation tool confirms this is a valid email address with proper MX records. Despite the domain name suggesting it might be temporary, the tool specifically indicates it is NOT a disposable email (valid: true, disposable: false). This address passes basic hygiene checks.\n\n### contact@example.co\nThe Email Existence Validator tool indicates this is NOT a disposable email address (disposable: false). However, example.co is a domain typically used for examples and documentation, so exercise caution as this may not be an actively monitored address despite not being technically disposable.\n\n## Domain Analysis\n\n### microsoft.com\nThe fast Email verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if microsoft.com is a disposable domain. Microsoft.com is a legitimate corporate domain and not a burner domain. No alternative domain suggestion is needed.\n\n## Website Contact Extraction\n\n### mailchimp.com\nThe Get emails from url tool only returned one email address from the mailchimp.com website: support@rapidapi.com. This is highly unusual and suggests the tool may have failed to properly scrape the site or is returning its own support email instead of Mailchimp's contact information. This result appears unreliable.\n\n## Summary\n- info@tempmail.org passes hygiene checks despite its name suggesting otherwise\n- contact@example.co is not disposable but is likely an example domain not meant for actual use\n- microsoft.com is a legitimate domain\n- Verification failed for john.doe@gmail.com due to API error\n- Tool malfunction prevented proper verification of support@rapidapi.com\n- Website contact extraction from mailchimp.com appears unreliable\n\nRecommendation: Before sending, manually verify john.doe@gmail.com and support@rapidapi.com through alternative means. Do not use contact@example.co as it's likely an example address. Consider quarantining any communications until proper verification is completed."

This appears to be an error in the tool's response, as it substituted the requested email with one from its own domain. Therefore, I cannot provide a proper pass for ceo@techfirm.com based on this result.\n\n2. **contact@innovatesolutions.net Verification (Email Address Validator)**:\n   The tool returned an error: \"API doesn't exists\". I cannot verify if this is a sensible, usable contact.\n\n3. **info@nexustech.io Mail Reception Check**:\n   Two tools were used to check this address:\n   - The fast Email verifier returned \"Not Found\"\n   - The Email Existence Validator showed unusual MX records with just \"[0, '.']\" which suggests this domain may not have proper mail server configuration. This indicates the email likely doesn't actually receive mail.\n\n4. **Public Contact Emails from techcompetitor.com**:\n   The tool only found 'support@rapidapi.com', which appears to be the API provider's email rather than an actual contact from techcompetitor.com. This suggests the tool may not have properly scraped the website or the site doesn't expose email addresses publicly.\n\n5. **info@digitalpartners.org Verification (Alpha Email Verification)**:\n   The tool reports this is not a disposable email address. However, this only tells us about the domain type, not whether the specific address is active or valid.\n\n6. **Additional Information**:\n   The Email API tool generated a random fake email (christopher.mills@peck.biz) which wasn't relevant to your request.\n\nIn summary, I cannot provide proper hygiene passes for any of the requested email addresses due to tool errors, incomplete information, or questionable results.

However, the tool appears to have returned the same test data as for carlos.rodriguez@gmail.com, so this verification may not be reliable.\n\n4. **akiko.tanaka@softbank.jp**: FAIL - The Email Existence Validator found no MX records for softbank.jp domain. This suggests mail sent to this address would not be delivered as the domain doesn't appear to have mail servers configured.\n\n5. **deutsche-bank.de**: The domain availability check returned 'Not Found', which likely means the tool failed to provide a result rather than indicating domain status.\n\n6. **emma.wilson@disposable-mail.com**: FAIL - This is confirmed to be a disposable email address. The Email Existence Validator explicitly marked it as disposable (True).\n\n7. **disposable-mail.com**: The tool returned 'Not Found' when checking if this is a disposable domain and suggesting alternatives. However, based on the previous check, this appears to be a burner domain.\n\nLimitations: Several tools returned errors or test data rather than actual verification results, so this assessment has significant reliability issues."

This suggests it's potentially a legitimate address rather than a one-time burner.\n\n2. **john.smith@acmecorp.com**: Unfortunately, the Email Address Validator tool returned an error ('API doesn't exist'), so I couldn't verify this address. No determination could be made about whether this is a sensible, usable contact.\n\n3. **contact@bigclient.com**: The Email Existence Validator found no MX records for bigclient.com, reporting: 'No MX Found The DNS response does not contain an answer to the question: bigclient.com. IN MX'. This indicates the domain likely cannot receive email, suggesting deliveries would fail.\n\n4. **mailinator.com domain check**: The tool for checking if mailinator.com is a disposable domain returned a 'Service Suspended' error. I cannot confirm if this is a burner domain.\n\n5. **Public emails from potentialclient.com**: The email extraction tool found only one email address on the contact page: support@rapidapi.com. This appears to be the API provider's support email rather than an actual contact from the potential client's website.\n\n6. **sarah.johnson@techfirm.net**: The Blaze Verify tool returned information for a completely different email (jarrett@blazeverify.com), which appears to be a sample response from the API provider rather than actual verification of your requested email.\n\n7. **Role account check for techfirm.net**: The tool returned 'Not Found', so I cannot determine if the address is a team/role inbox.\n\nImportant note: Several tools returned errors or sample data rather than actual verification results, significantly limiting the reliability of this analysis."

This indicates an error with the tool rather than a definitive answer about domain availability. I cannot provide a reliable yes/no on this.\n\n3. **contact@acme-corp.com**: The verification tool returned results for a completely different email address (jarrett@blazeverify.com) instead of the requested address. This appears to be an error with the tool or API configuration. I cannot provide a proper assessment of contact@acme-corp.com.\n\n4. **info@cloudflare.com**: The Email Existence Validator successfully retrieved MX records for cloudflare.com, showing that the domain has properly configured mail servers with multiple MX records pointing to Cloudflare's email security infrastructure. However, we couldn't specifically verify if info@cloudflare.com receives mail as the SMTP check tool returned \"Not Found\".\n\n5. **RapidAPI contact emails**: Successfully retrieved one public contact email from rapidapi.com: support@rapidapi.com.\n\n6. **john.smith@gmial.com**: The Email Address Validator returned \"API doesn't exist\" when attempting to validate this address. Note that this appears to be a misspelled Gmail address (\"gmial\" instead of \"gmail\").\n\n7. **Role account check**: The tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking for role accounts associated with cloudflare.com.\n\nIn summary, I can only provide definitive information about maria@tempmail.org (not disposable) and the contact email for RapidAPI (support@rapidapi.com).

This appears to be a legitimate business contact email.\n\n3. **john.smith@gmail.com**: The Blaze Verify tool returned information, but there seems to be a mismatch in the results. The output shows details for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com' instead of the requested email. This suggests an error in the tool's response or configuration.\n\n4. **support@quickmail.io**: The Email Validation tool returned an error: 'You are not subscribed to this API.' I couldn't verify this email address.\n\n5. **quickmail.io domain**: The Fast Email Verifier tool returned 'Not Found' when checking if this domain is available, which typically means the domain is already taken/registered.\n\n6. **contact@ourcompany.com**: The Email Address Validator returned an error: 'API doesn't exist.' I couldn't verify this email address.\n\n7. **Public emails from mailchimp.com**: The tool only returned 'support@rapidapi.com', which appears to be the API provider's email rather than actual Mailchimp contact information. This result is likely incorrect or limited.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- Exercise caution with sarah.jones@tempmail.org until you can confirm whether tempmail.org is a legitimate domain\n- The john.smith@gmail.com verification returned unexpected results and should be re-checked\n- Several tools returned errors, suggesting you may need alternative verification methods\n- Consider using a different tool to extract Mailchimp contact information"

The tool shows this email as 'deliverable' with a score of 100, but this doesn't help us evaluate your target address.

The verification was performed on August 20, 2025, and clearly identified it as temporary. This means it's likely a one-time use address that shouldn't be pursued for meaningful communication.\n\n## updates@yahoo.com\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned inconsistent results for updates@yahoo.com. While it was supposed to verify this address, the output shows verification for a completely different email (jarrett@blazeverify.com). This means **we don't have proper verification data for updates@yahoo.com**. The tool appears to have returned sample data or had an error, making it impossible to determine if updates@yahoo.com is a legitimate contact.\n\n## newsletter@gmail.com\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool confirms that **newsletter@gmail.com is NOT a disposable email address**. While gmail.com is a legitimate domain, this particular address follows a pattern often used for bulk communications rather than personal use. It appears to be a functional address, though likely used for sending rather than receiving communications.\n\n## admin@acmetech.com\nThe Email Existence Validator retrieved MX records for admin@acmetech.com on September 8, 2025. The domain has **multiple valid MX records pointing to Google's mail servers** (aspmx.l.google.com and alternatives), indicating it's properly configured to receive email. This suggests the address is set up for mail delivery, though we don't have explicit verification that the specific mailbox exists.\n\n## Summary of Findings:\n- \u274c **support@mailinator.com**: Confirmed disposable address - don't pursue\n- \u2753 **updates@yahoo.com**: Verification failed - need to recheck\n- \u2705 **newsletter@gmail.com**: Not disposable, appears legitimate\n- \u2705 **admin@acmetech.com**: Domain has valid mail servers, likely receives mail\n\nNote: The GetTempMail and Email API tools were used but their outputs (cleanup@gettempmail.com and christopher.mills@peck.biz respectively) don't relate to the addresses you asked about."

This appears to be the API provider's support email rather than actual contact information from the blog, indicating the tool may have failed to properly scrape the target website or the blog doesn't contain public email addresses.\n\n## Disposable Email Verification\n- **competitor@tempmail.org**: The Email Existence Validator reports this is NOT a disposable email (status: ok, disposable: false).

It's likely a typo of amazon.com (note the double 'n').\n   - **Suggestion**: Use support@amazon.com instead.\n\n2. **news@nytimess.com**\n   - No MX records found for nytimess.com domain.\n   - **Action Required**: This domain cannot receive emails.

However, based on naming patterns:\n\n1. **amazonn.com** - Likely a typo of amazon.com (extra 'n').\n2. **microsoftt.com** - Likely a typo of microsoft.com (extra 't').\n3. **appleid.com** - This could be attempting to mimic Apple's services, but Apple typically uses apple.com or icloud.com domains.\n\n## Summary\n\n- **Avoid**: updates@mailinator.com (confirmed disposable)\n- **Suspicious domains that cannot receive email**: amazonn.com, nytimess.com, yahoomail.net\n- **Potential typos to correct**: amazonn.com \u2192 amazon.com, nytimess.com \u2192 nytimes.com, microsoftt.com \u2192 microsoft.com\n- **Quarantine recommended** for all emails from these suspicious domains as they appear to be typosquatting attempts that could be used for phishing."

Users likely meant to use a legitimate business email instead.\n\n2. **contact@besttempmail.com**: Email Existence Validator confirms this is a disposable email address (marked as disposable: true). Don't chase this contact as it's likely a throwaway address.\n\n3. **newsletter@mailinator.com**: The tool returned information for a different email (jarrett@blazeverify.com) rather than the requested address. This appears to be an error in the tool's response. However, mailinator.com is a well-known disposable email service, so this is almost certainly not a legitimate contact.\n\n4. **notifications@example.org**: Email Existence Validator shows this domain has an MX record of '.' which is invalid. This address won't receive emails - it's swallowing deliveries as you suspected. The example.org domain is reserved for documentation and not meant for actual use.\n\n5. **admin@gmail.com**: The Email Address Validator tool returned an error ('API doesn't exist'). However, this is likely a personal Gmail address rather than a role-based inbox. While it may be valid, it's not ideal for business communications.\n\n6. **domain.org**: The tool returned a 'Service Suspended' error, so I can't verify availability. Based on general knowledge, domain.org is already taken (it's owned by the Public Interest Registry).\n\n7. **info@company.com**: Email Validation confirms this is a valid, non-disposable email address. The 'info@' prefix indicates this is likely a role-based inbox for general inquiries.\n\n8. **support@tempmail.org**: Alpha Email Verification indicates this is NOT a disposable email (disposable: false), which is surprising given the domain name. This may be a legitimate support address despite the suspicious domain name.\n\n9. **updates@yahoo.com**: Easy Email Validation confirms this is a valid, non-disposable email with working MX records. This appears to be a legitimate Yahoo address, though likely a role-based inbox rather than personal.\n\nThe tool for checking role-based inboxes returned an error, so I couldn't definitively identify which addresses are team/role inboxes, though info@company.com, support@tempmail.org, and updates@yahoo.com likely are based on their prefixes."

Consider manual verification.\n\n2. **disposable-mail.com**: The tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if this is a disposable domain. This requires further investigation as the tool couldn't provide a definitive answer.\n\n3. **marketing@yahoo.com**: Unable to verify - the tool returned an error message stating \"API doesn't exist\". Yahoo is generally a legitimate email provider, but this specific address should be verified through other means.\n\n4. **newsletter@mailinator.com**: The verification tool returned misleading results. It appears the tool substituted a different email (jarrett@blazeverify.com) in its response. Mailinator is actually a well-known disposable email service, so this address should be flagged as temporary/disposable.\n\n5. **contact@besttempmail.com**: FLAGGED AS DISPOSABLE. The Email Existence Validator confirmed this is a disposable email address. You should quarantine this contact as it's likely a throwaway address.\n\n6. **support@tempmail.org**: The verification tool indicates this is NOT a disposable email. However, the domain name \"tempmail.org\" strongly suggests a temporary email service despite the tool result. I recommend treating with caution.\n\n7. **updates@gmail.com**: The tool verified that Gmail's MX records are properly configured, showing multiple valid mail servers. Gmail is a legitimate service, but this specific address may be a high-volume or unmonitored inbox.\n\n8. **info@company-alerts.net**: Verified as valid and NOT disposable. The tool indicates the domain is legitimate, though it noted \"mxRecord: False\" which is concerning as it suggests mail delivery issues.\n\n9. **freemailservice.net domain availability**: The tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking availability. This requires further verification through a domain registrar.\n\nRecommended actions:\n- Quarantine contact@besttempmail.com as it's confirmed disposable\n- Treat support@tempmail.org with caution despite the tool result\n- Verify info@company-alerts.net's MX record configuration\n- Use alternative methods to verify the remaining addresses"
