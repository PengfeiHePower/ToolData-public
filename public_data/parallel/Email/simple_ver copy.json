It might be interesting to compare what different assessment methods say about them. Also, for our upcoming system test, we should probably have a realistic but non-existent business contact ready. I'm curious what contact information might be publicly available on that industry website we often check for competitive analysis. And speaking of digital footprints, I've been wondering about the nature of those three web domains we keep an eye on - our main competitor, that fintech player, and the banking solutions provider.
