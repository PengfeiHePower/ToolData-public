This suggests there was an error in the verification process or the tool returned incorrect data. The tool shows this email as 'deliverable' with a score of 100, but since it's for a different address, we cannot make conclusions about info@acmetech.com.\n\n3. **Role/Team Inbox Check**:\nThe Role Account verification tool was used to check gmail.com rather than the specific domains you requested (tempmail.org or acmetech.com). The result shows 'gmail.com is not a RoleAccount domain,' but this doesn't address your specific query about whether support@tempmail.org or info@acmetech.com are role accounts. Based on common naming conventions, 'support@' and 'info@' typically indicate role accounts, but we don't have direct verification.\n\n4. **Domain Availability Check for missingdomain123.xyz**:\nThe FreeDomain tool returned 'Not Found' for missingdomain123.xyz. This response is ambiguous and doesn't clearly indicate whether the domain is available or taken.\n\nIn summary, the tools provided partial or potentially misleading information for most of your requests.

This response is ambiguous and could mean either:\n1. The domain is available for registration\n2. The API encountered an error processing the request\n3. The information about this domain is not in the database\n\nAdditional verification would be needed to determine the actual status of this domain.\n\n## Disposable Domain Check: mycompany.com\nUsing fast Email verifier's disposable Domain checker, I confirmed that mycompany.com is NOT a disposable domain. The tool returned: \"mycompany.com is not a disposable domain\". This means it's suitable for business use.\n\nThe tool also attempted to suggest alternative spellings but found no possible misspellings for mycompany.com.\n\n## Summary\n- The verification for john.smith@gmail.com returned incorrect data (different email address)\n- sales@disposable-mail.com is confirmed as a disposable email address and should be flagged\n- The status of temporarymail.org is unclear from the \"Not Found\" response\n- mycompany.com is a legitimate (non-disposable) domain suitable for business use"

This may indicate a limitation in the tool's database.\n\n### sarah.smith@gmail.com\nThe Email Existence Validator successfully retrieved MX records for this address:\n- Valid MX records found (5 records in total)\n- Primary MX: gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com (priority 5)\n- This confirms the domain has proper mail server configuration and can receive emails\n\n### info@mailinator.org\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned inconsistent results for this address:\n- The tool shows the email as 'deliverable' with a score of 100\n- However, the returned details appear to be for a completely different email (jarrett@blazeverify.com)\n- This suggests an error in the tool's response or API configuration\n- Note: Mailinator is typically a disposable email service, so this result is questionable\n\n## Role/Team Inbox Check\nThe attempt to check for role accounts using the fast Email verifier returned **Not Found** for the domain 'acmetech.com'.

This result is not relevant to your query and should be disregarded.\n\n### contact@missingdomain123.com\n- **Mail Server Status**: No MX records found\n- **Deliverability**: Not deliverable - the domain does not exist\n- **Error Message**: \"No MX Found The DNS query name does not exist: missingdomain123.com\"\n\n## Role/Team Inbox Check\n- **Tool Limitation**: The role account check for a specific domain returned \"Not Found\". The tool was executed with \"acme-corp.com\" instead of the domains you requested, so no relevant information was provided.\n\n## Domain Availability Checks\n\n### yahoo.com\n- **Status**: Available (reported as \"yahoo.com is a Free domain\")\n- **Note**: This result is likely incorrect as yahoo.com is a well-established domain owned by Yahoo. The tool may have misinterpreted the query or provided erroneous information.\n\n### ourpartner.biz\n- **Disposable Status**: The tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if this is a disposable domain\n- **Alternative Suggestion**: No alternative was provided due to the tool error\n\n## Summary\nThe verification results are incomplete and partially unreliable. We confirmed support@tempmail.org is valid and not disposable, but is a role account. The verification for john.doe@gmail.com returned irrelevant data. The domain missingdomain123.com does not exist. The yahoo.com availability check returned questionable results, and the disposable domain check for ourpartner.biz failed to provide any information."

However, I should note that this result contradicts common expectations, as 'tempmail123.com' appears to have a name suggesting it might be a temporary email service. The tool may have limitations in its disposable email database.\n\n### john.smith@gmail.com\n- **Blaze Verify Tool**: The tool returned information, but there appears to be a discrepancy in the results. The output shows information for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com' rather than the requested email address. This suggests the tool may have encountered an error or returned sample data instead of analyzing the actual email provided. Therefore, we cannot make accurate conclusions about john.smith@gmail.com's validity or deliverability.\n\n### support@company.org\n- **Email Existence Validator Tool**: No MX records found for this domain. The tool reported a timeout error after 5 seconds when attempting to resolve the MX records. This suggests that company.org may not have properly configured mail servers or the domain might not exist.\n\n### contact@mydomain.co\n- **Easy Email Validation Tool**: This email has valid format but NO MX record was found.

This could either mean the domain is available for registration or that the tool couldn't process the request properly. Additional verification is recommended.\n\n### disposable-mail.net\n- **Fast Email Verifier (Disposable Domain) Tool**: The tool returned \"Not Found\" which is inconclusive. This could mean either the domain is not in their disposable domain database, or the tool failed to properly check the domain. No alternative domain was suggested as expected.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe hygiene sweep revealed several issues: support@company.org has no valid MX records, contact@mydomain.co has valid format but no MX records for mail delivery, and we received inconclusive or potentially erroneous results for the other checks.

Therefore, I cannot provide validation or deliverability information for this address. Note that the domain appears to be misspelled (\"gmial.com\" instead of \"gmail.com\"), which suggests this is likely an invalid address.\n\n## 2. support@tempmail.org Disposable Check\nUsing the Alpha Email Verification tool, I found that **support@tempmail.org is NOT flagged as disposable**. Despite the domain name suggesting it might be a temporary email service, the verification tool indicates it's not classified as a disposable email provider.\n\n## 3. freeemail.co Domain Check\nI attempted to check if freeemail.co is a disposable domain using the fast Email verifier tool, but received a \"Not Found\" response. This means I cannot determine if this is a disposable domain or suggest alternatives based on the available tools.\n\n## 4. Role/Team Inbox Check\nI attempted to check for role/team inboxes using the fast Email verifier tool with the domain \"businessmail.com\", but received a \"Not Found\" response. Note that this check was not performed on the specific addresses mentioned in your query (support/sales addresses).\n\n## 5. ceo@startup-ventures.net Mail Server Status\nUsing the Email Existence Validator tool, I found that the domain startup-ventures.net has **no MX records**. The tool reported: \"No MX Found The DNS response does not contain an answer to the question: startup-ventures.net. IN MX\". This indicates that the domain is not configured to receive email, making ceo@startup-ventures.net undeliverable.\n\n## 6. contact@10minutemail.org Verification\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned unexpected results for this check. Instead of verifying contact@10minutemail.org, it returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com, which appears to be a sample or default response. Therefore, I cannot provide valid verification for contact@10minutemail.org.\n\n## 7. info@acme-corp.com Verification\nUsing the Email Validation_v3 tool, I found that info@acme-corp.com:\n- Is properly formatted\n- Is NOT disposable\n- Is identified as a role account (TRUE)\n- Has MX record status: FALSE\n- Has no MX records listed\n\nThis suggests the email address is properly formatted but may not be deliverable due to missing MX records for the domain.\n\n## Summary\n- john.doe@gmial.com: Verification failed (API error), likely invalid due to misspelled domain\n- support@tempmail.org: Not flagged as disposable despite the name suggesting otherwise\n- freeemail.co: Unable to determine if disposable (tool returned \"Not Found\")\n- Role/team inbox check: Unable to perform specific checks (tool returned \"Not Found\")\n- ceo@startup-ventures.net: Undeliverable due to missing MX records\n- contact@10minutemail.org: Verification failed (tool returned data for a different email)\n- info@acme-corp.com: Properly formatted, not disposable, is a role account, but likely undeliverable due to missing MX records"

The tool reported that support@tempmail.org is **NOT disposable**. However, this contradicts common knowledge as tempmail.org is typically a disposable email service. This may indicate a limitation in the tool's database.\n\n## 2. marketing@company-domain.com\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned results for a different email address (jarrett@blazeverify.com) instead of the requested marketing@company-domain.com. This appears to be an error in the tool's response, making it impossible to verify the requested address.\n\n## 3. admin@mailinator.com\nThe Email Existence Validator confirmed that admin@mailinator.com is indeed a **disposable/temporary email address**. This is accurate as Mailinator is a well-known temporary email service.\n\n## 4. info@gmail.com\nThe Email Validation_v3 tool returned an error: \"You are not subscribed to this API.\" Therefore, I cannot verify the validity and deliverability of info@gmail.com.\n\n## 5. contact@yahoo.net\nThe Email Address Validator tool returned an error: \"API doesn't exists.\" Therefore, I cannot verify the validity and deliverability of contact@yahoo.net.\n\n## 6. sales@outlook.com\nThe Easy Email Validation tool confirmed that sales@outlook.com is:\n- Valid: Yes\n- Domain: outlook.com\n- Disposable: No\n- MX Record: Present\n\nThis indicates the email is properly formatted and potentially deliverable.\n\n## 7. protonmail.com domain availability\nThe Fast Email Verifier: FreeDomain tool returned \"Not Found.\" This could either mean the tool failed or the domain is not available (which is accurate as ProtonMail is an established email service).\n\n## 8. hotmail.com disposable check\nThe Fast Email Verifier: disposable Domain and Suggest Domain tool returned \"Not Found.\" This means I cannot determine if hotmail.com is disposable or provide alternatives.\n\n## 9. feedback@aol.com mail server status\nThe Email Existence Validator successfully retrieved MX records for feedback@aol.com:\n- MX Record: mx-aol.mail.gm0.yahoodns.net (priority 10)\n\nThis indicates the domain has valid mail servers configured to accept email.\n\n## Summary\nDue to several tool errors and limitations, this hygiene check is incomplete. I was able to confirm that admin@mailinator.com is disposable, sales@outlook.com is valid, and feedback@aol.com has proper mail server configuration.

Instead of checking support@tempmail.org, the tool returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com. This suggests an error in the API response or a redirection issue. The returned email shows as deliverable with a 100% score, not disposable, and not a role account - but this is for the wrong email address.\n\n## 2. john.doe@gmail.com Verification\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool confirmed that john.doe@gmail.com is **not a disposable email address**. Gmail is a legitimate email service provider, so this result is as expected.\n\n## 3. info@company-domain.co Server Status\nThe Email Existence Validator reported that company-domain.co has **no MX records found**. The specific error was: \"No MX Found The DNS query name does not exist: company-domain.co.\" This means the domain likely doesn't exist or isn't configured to receive email, so info@company-domain.co would not be deliverable.\n\n## 4. marketing@disposable-mail.com Analysis\nThe Email Existence Validator confirmed that marketing@disposable-mail.com is associated with a **disposable/temporary email domain**. This address should be flagged as potentially problematic for marketing or important communications.\n\n## 5-8. Tool Failures\nMultiple tools from the fast Email verifier service returned \"Not Found\" responses for:\n- Checking if mispeleddomian.com is disposable and suggesting alternatives\n- Checking if an address is a role/team inbox\n- Checking if freemailservice.com is available\n- Server-level reachability check\n\nThese failures indicate either API issues, incorrect parameters, or limitations in the service.\n\n## 9. help@quickmail.io Verification\nThe Email Validation_v3 tool returned an error: \"You are not subscribed to this API.\" This means the verification could not be completed due to subscription or authentication issues.\n\n## Summary\nOnly partial results were obtained due to multiple tool failures. From the successful checks:\n- john.doe@gmail.com is a legitimate, non-disposable email address\n- company-domain.co lacks MX records, making info@company-domain.co undeliverable\n- marketing@disposable-mail.com is confirmed to be a disposable/temporary email address\n\nThe verification for support@tempmail.org returned incorrect data, and several other requested checks failed completely due to API errors or subscription issues."

Role/Team Inbox Check\nAttempted to check role accounts for ourwebsite.org using fast Email verifier.\n- Result: **Not Found**\n- The tool was unable to provide information about role accounts for this domain.\n\n## 7. yahoo.com Domain Availability\nUsing fast Email verifier, I checked if yahoo.com is available.\n- Result: **yahoo.com is a Free domain**\n- The tool indicates yahoo.com is a free domain, though this likely means it's a free email provider rather than being available for registration (as yahoo.com is certainly already registered).\n\n## 8. Server-level Reachability Check\nAttempted to check SMTP configuration for service@hotmail.com using fast Email verifier.\n- Result: **Not Found**\n- The tool was unable to provide server-level reachability information.\n\n## 9. webmaster@domain.net Verification\nAttempted to verify webmaster@domain.net using Email Address Validator.\n- Result: **Error - API doesn't exist**\n- The tool returned an error message indicating the API is not available.\n\n## 10. newsletter@freemail.com Verification\nAttempted to verify newsletter@freemail.com using Email Validation_v3.\n- Result: **Error - Not subscribed to this API**\n- The tool returned an error message indicating lack of subscription access.\n\n## Summary\nThe email hygiene checks were only partially successful due to multiple tool errors and limitations. From the successful checks, we found that support@tempmail.org and sales@disposable.com are not flagged as disposable emails, info@mycompany.com lacks proper MX records (making it undeliverable), and yahoo.com is identified as a free email domain. Several other checks could not be completed due to API errors, service suspensions, or subscription issues."

The tool returned information for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com' instead of the requested 'john.doe@gmail.com'. This suggests an error in the API response or a limitation in the tool's functionality. The returned email shows as deliverable with a score of 100, but this is not relevant to our query.\n\n### 3. info@mycompany.com\n**Email Existence Validator** found no MX records for this domain, indicating that this email address is likely not valid as the domain cannot receive emails.\n\n### 4. sales@disposable.cc\n**Email Existence Validator** determined that sales@disposable.cc is NOT a disposable email address, despite the domain name suggesting otherwise.\n\n### 5. contact@business-domain.com\n**Email Address Validator** returned an error: \"API doesn't exist\". We cannot verify this email address with the provided tool.\n\n### 6. help@mailinator.com\n**Email Validation_v3** returned an error: \"You are not subscribed to this API\". We cannot verify this email address with the provided tool. Note that Mailinator is generally known to be a disposable email service.\n\n### 7. throwaway.email (domain check)\n**Fast Email Verifier** returned \"Not Found\". We cannot determine if this is a disposable domain or get alternative suggestions.\n\n### 8. legitimate-business.org (domain availability)\n**Fast Email Verifier** returned \"Not Found\". We cannot determine if this domain is available or already taken.\n\n### 9. Role/team inbox check\n**Fast Email Verifier** returned \"Not Found\" when checking corporate.net. Additionally, the query asked to check if specific addresses were role accounts, but the tool was used with a different domain than those in the query.\n\n### 10. feedback@example.com\n**Easy Email Validation** confirmed that feedback@example.com is valid, has MX records, and is NOT a disposable email address. Note that example.com is a reserved domain for documentation purposes and not intended for actual email use.\n\n## Summary\nDue to multiple tool errors and limitations, we could only partially complete the requested email hygiene tasks. Several tools returned errors or unexpected results, and some checks could not be performed. Of the emails we could verify:\n- support@tempmail.org: Not flagged as disposable\n- sales@disposable.cc: Not flagged as disposable\n- feedback@example.com: Valid format with MX records, not disposable (but note this is a reserved example domain)\n- info@mycompany.com: Likely invalid due to no MX records\n\nThe verification for john.doe@gmail.com returned incorrect data, and we couldn't verify contact@business-domain.com, help@mailinator.com, check throwaway.email's status, determine legitimate-business.org's availability, or verify role account status for any of the addresses."

This is likely not a legitimate contact email for brightfuture.org, but rather the support email for the RapidAPI platform that powers the email extraction tool itself. This indicates that either:\n- The website does not publicly display email addresses\n- The email extraction tool had limited functionality or access\n- The tool may have returned its own support contact instead of website content\n\n## Summary\nThe deliverability review for brightfuture.org shows potential issues with email server configuration. No valid email addresses were found on the domain, and the website does not appear to publicly display contact email addresses.

This means we couldn't determine whether newdomain.xyz is disposable, nor could we generate alternative domain suggestions as requested.\n\n4. **gmail.com**: The domain availability check indicates that \"gmail.com is a Free domain\". This means gmail.com is already taken and in use (as we would expect for Google's email service).

This suggests a potential limitation in the tool's database or detection capability.\n\n2. **Mail Server Status for support@microsoft.com**:\n   - The Email Existence Validator successfully retrieved MX records for microsoft.com.\n   - Result shows the domain has valid MX records with priority 10 pointing to 'microsoft-com.mail.protection.outlook.com'.\n   - This confirms the domain has proper mail server configuration, but doesn't specifically verify the accept-mail status for the support@ address.\n\n3. **Server-level Reachability Check**:\n   - The attempted SMTP check using fast Email verifier returned 'Not Found'.\n   - This check was performed for 'info@mycompany.org' rather than either of the addresses in your query, so it doesn't provide relevant information.\n\n4. **Role/Team Inbox Check**:\n   - The Role Account check returned 'Not Found'.\n   - This check was performed for 'startup-domain.com' rather than microsoft.com or tempmail.org, so it doesn't provide relevant information about whether support@microsoft.com is a role/team inbox.\n\nIn summary, the tools only partially addressed your requirements.

Unfortunately, no alternative domain was suggested due to this limitation.\n\n## Email API Check\n\nThe Email API tool successfully generated a fake business email address for testing purposes:\n- Email: christopher.mills@peck.biz\n- Job Title: Learning disability nurse\n\nThis demonstrates the Email API's functionality but doesn't specifically check if the domain is disposable.\n\n## Contact Email Extraction from techcompetitor.com\n\nThe email extraction tool found only one email address on the specified website:\n- support@rapidapi.com\n\nThis result is likely limited as it appears to be the email of the API service provider rather than actual contacts from techcompetitor.com. The tool may have failed to access the actual website content or the website might not display email addresses publicly.\n\n## Email Verification for marketing@potentialclient.com\n\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned results for a different email than requested. Instead of verifying marketing@potentialclient.com, it provided information for jarrett@blazeverify.com:\n- State: deliverable\n- Score: 100\n- Disposable: False\n- Accept All: False\n\nThis appears to be an error or limitation in the tool's response, as it didn't verify the requested email address.\n\n## GetTempMail Check\n\nThe GetTempMail tool successfully created a temporary email address:\n- campaign_test@gettempmail.com\n\nThis confirms the tool's functionality but doesn't provide verification information about this address.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe tools provided partial or incorrect information for most of the requested checks. We couldn't definitively determine if techsolutions.org is disposable, no alternative domain was suggested, and the email verification checked the wrong address. The contact extraction from the competitor's website likely returned API provider information rather than actual website contacts.

Unfortunately, no alternative domain suggestion was provided due to this limitation.\n\n## Email Extraction from techrivalsolutions.com\nThe Get emails from url tool extracted only one email from https://www.techrivalsolutions.com/contact:\n- support@rapidapi.com\n\nThis result is likely incomplete or misleading as it appears to be returning the RapidAPI support email rather than actual contact emails from the techrivalsolutions.com website. This suggests the tool may have limitations in accessing the actual content of the target website.\n\n## Email API Check\nThe Email API tool generated a fake business email for testing purposes:\n- Email: christopher.mills@peck.biz\n- Job Title: Learning disability nurse\n\nThis demonstrates the tool's functionality for creating test email addresses with associated job titles.\n\n## GetTempMail Check\nThe GetTempMail tool successfully created a temporary email address as requested:\n- Temporary Email: campaign_test_2023@gettempmail.com\n\nThis confirms the tool's ability to generate disposable email addresses for testing purposes.\n\n## Summary\nThe mail server for techcorp.com is properly configured to accept mail. The disposable domain check for quickmail.io was inconclusive due to tool limitations. The email extraction from techrivalsolutions.com appears to have returned RapidAPI's support email rather than site-specific contacts. Both the Email API and GetTempMail tools successfully demonstrated their core functionality of generating test/temporary email addresses."

This email appears legitimate and deliverable.\n\n2. **info@temporarymail.org Validation**:\n   The Alpha Email Verification tool confirmed that info@temporarymail.org is a disposable email address. This should be flagged as problematic since disposable emails are typically used to avoid identification or for temporary access, which could indicate potential abuse.\n\n3. **marketing@company.net Validation**:\n   The Blaze Verify tool returned results, but there appears to be a discrepancy in the output. Instead of validating marketing@company.net, the tool returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com. This suggests either an error in the API response or a redirection issue. Based on the available data, I cannot confirm the validity of marketing@company.net.\n\n4. **contact@gmail.com Mail Server Status**:\n   The Email Existence Validator successfully retrieved MX records for gmail.com, showing that the domain has multiple mail servers configured in priority order (5, 10, 20, 30, 40). This indicates that gmail.com's mail servers are properly configured to accept mail. However, the tool did not specifically verify if contact@gmail.com itself is deliverable.\n\n5. **disposable.cc Domain Check**:\n   The fast Email verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if disposable.cc is a disposable domain.

The disposable domain check failed due to a suspended service, and I was able to generate both a fake business email and a temporary email address for testing purposes."

The result was:\n- 'gmail.com is not a RoleAccount domain'\n\nThis doesn't provide information about whether marketing@ourcompany.com is a role/team inbox.\n\n## Email Extraction from mailchimp.com\nI attempted to extract public contact emails from https://www.mailchimp.com, but the tool returned limited results:\n- Only one email found: support@rapidapi.com\n\n**Important limitation**: This appears to be the support email for RapidAPI (the API marketplace) rather than actual Mailchimp contact emails, suggesting the tool may have limitations in extracting emails from modern websites or may have scanned a different page than intended.\n\n## Email Existence Validator Check\nI ran the help page for the Email Existence Validator tool, which provided information about supported email domains:\n- Supported domains include: gmail.com, outlook.com, hotmail.com, yahoo.com, aol.com, rediffmail.com, proton.me, protonmail.com, icloud.com, me.com, mac.com\n- Documentation available at: https://rapidapi.com/deveshkumarsingh75/api/email-existence-validator/\n\n**Note**: This was a help page request rather than an actual email validation check.\n\n## Summary\nI've completed the requested hygiene checks, though several had limitations. The verification of marketing@ourcompany.com returned unexpected results, the role account check was performed on the wrong domain, and the email extraction from mailchimp.com yielded only a RapidAPI support email rather than Mailchimp contact information. The Email Existence Validator provided only documentation information rather than performing an actual validation."

Despite the domain name suggesting it might be disposable, the tool indicates this is actually not a disposable email address.\n\n## support@tempmail.org\nThe Email Existence Validator tool checked this address. **Result: Not disposable**. According to the verification completed on August 20, 2025, this email is not classified as a temporary/throwaway address, which is surprising given the domain name typically associated with temporary email services.\n\n## info@newstartup.co\nThe Email Existence Validator tool checked MX records for this domain. **Result: Invalid domain**. The tool returned \"No MX Found The DNS query name does not exist: newstartup.co\" on September 8, 2025. This means the domain doesn't have mail servers configured, so emails sent to this address would not be deliverable.\n\n## Role/Team Inbox Check\nThe attempt to check for role accounts using the fast Email verifier tool **failed**. The service returned a \"Service Suspended\" message, so we couldn't determine whether any addresses are role/team inboxes.\n\n## yahoo.com Domain Availability\nThe fast Email verifier FreeDomain tool checked this domain. **Result: Free domain**. The tool reported \"yahoo.com is a Free domain\" which is misleading since Yahoo is a well-established company. This likely indicates an error in the tool's response or terminology, as yahoo.com is certainly not available for registration.\n\n## quickmail.me Disposable Domain Check\nThe fast Email verifier disposable Domain tool was used to check this domain. **Result: Not Found**. The tool failed to provide information about whether quickmail.me is a disposable domain, and no alternative was suggested.\n\n## marketing@gmail.com Verification\nThe Blaze Verify tool was used to check this email. **Result: The tool returned information for a different email address entirely** (jarrett@blazeverify.com). This appears to be an error in the tool's response, as it did not verify the requested email address.\n\n# Summary\nThe validation results are mixed and contain several inconsistencies or errors. Two supposedly disposable domains (disposablemail.com and tempmail.org) were flagged as non-disposable. The newstartup.co domain doesn't have valid MX records. The role account check service is suspended. The yahoo.com availability check returned a misleading result. The quickmail.me check failed, and the marketing@gmail.com verification returned data for a completely different email address. These inconsistencies suggest potential issues with the reliability of the tools used for validation."

Verification for cto@techcorp.com\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned results, but there appears to be a discrepancy in the data. The tool shows information for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com' rather than the requested 'cto@techcorp.com'. This suggests the tool may have returned sample data or there was an error in processing the specific address. The returned data shows:\n- State: deliverable\n- Score: 100\n- Accept all: False\n- Disposable: False\n\n### 2. Temporary/Throwaway Check for sarah.dev@gmail.com\nThe Email Existence Validator confirmed that sarah.dev@gmail.com is NOT a disposable or temporary email address:\n- Disposable: False\n- Status: ok\n\n### 3. Server-level Reachability Check\nThe fast Email verifier SMTP check for info@techcorp.com returned \"Not Found\", indicating the email address could not be verified at the server level or the server is not properly configured to respond to such checks.\n\n### 4. Email API Check\nThe Email API tool was used to generate a fake business email rather than perform verification. It returned:\n- Fake email: christopher.mills@peck.biz\n- Job title: Learning disability nurse\nThis doesn't address the verification request in the query.\n\n## Website Email Extraction\n\n### 5. Emails from techrivalsolutions.com\nThe email extraction tool only found one email address on the website:\n- support@rapidapi.com\nThis appears to be the API provider's support email rather than actual contact emails for techrivalsolutions.com, suggesting the tool may have limitations in extracting emails from this particular site.\n\n## Mail Server Checks\n\n### 6. Mail Server Status for info@startupinc.org\nThe Email Existence Validator successfully retrieved MX records for startupinc.org:\n- MX Records: mx1.hostinger.com (priority 5), mx2.hostinger.com (priority 10)\n- Status: ok\nThis confirms the domain has properly configured mail servers, though it doesn't specifically verify if the address accepts mail.\n\n### 7. Domain Availability Check for gmail.com\nThe fast Email verifier reported that \"gmail.com is a Free domain\". This result is confusing as gmail.com is certainly not available for registration (it's owned by Google). The tool may be using \"Free\" to indicate something other than availability status.\n\n### 8. GetTempMail Check\nThe GetTempMail tool was used to create a temporary email address (campaign-monitor@gettempmail.com) rather than perform a verification check as requested.\n\n## Summary\nThe tools provided mixed results with some apparent limitations. The verification for cto@techcorp.com returned data for a different email address. The sarah.dev@gmail.com check confirmed it's not a disposable address. The website email extraction likely missed actual contact emails from techrivalsolutions.com. The mail server check for startupinc.org confirmed proper MX records exist. The domain check for gmail.com returned potentially misleading information. Two of the tools (Email API and GetTempMail) were used to create emails rather than verify existing ones."

Instead, it returned information for a different email address: jarrett@blazeverify.com, which appears to be a sample response. The actual status of sarah@disposable-temp.org remains unknown.\n\n### 3. contact@mycompany.net\n**Tool Used**: Email Address Validator\n**Result**: INCOMPLETE - The tool returned an error message: \"API doesn't exists.\" Unable to verify this email address.\n\n### 4. info@conferencehost.com\n**Tool Used**: Easy Email Validation\n**Result**: \n- Valid format: Yes\n- Domain: conferencehost.com\n- Disposable: No\n- MX Record: No (This suggests potential deliverability issues)\n\n### 5. support@eventplanner.co\n**Tool Used**: Alpha Email Verification\n**Result**: \n- Disposable: No (Not flagged as a disposable domain)\n\n## Additional Checks\n\n### Email API Check\n**Tool Used**: Email API: Get Fake Email Address\n**Result**: The tool generated a fake email (christopher.mills@peck.biz) with job title \"Learning disability nurse\" rather than performing verification. This doesn't address the requested check.\n\n### Mail Server Status for contact@mycompany.net\n**Tool Used**: Email Existence Validator\n**Result**: No MX records found for mycompany.net. The DNS operation timed out multiple times. This indicates the domain likely doesn't have mail servers configured, making the email address undeliverable.\n\n### Disposable Domain Check for disposable-temp.org\n**Tool Used**: fast Email verifier\n**Result**: \"Not Found\" - The tool was unable to provide information about whether disposable-temp.org is a disposable domain. No alternative domain was suggested.\n\n### Email Extraction from techconference2023.org\n**Tool Used**: Get emails from url\n**Result**: Only one email was found: support@rapidapi.com. This appears to be related to the API service itself rather than actual contact emails from the conference website.\n\n## Summary\nThe verification process was largely unsuccessful due to API subscription issues and errors. From the limited successful results, we can determine that info@conferencehost.com has valid format but lacks MX records (suggesting deliverability issues), support@eventplanner.co is not from a disposable domain, and contact@mycompany.net appears undeliverable due to missing MX records. For a complete deliverability assessment, you would need to resolve the API access issues or try alternative verification services."

The tool returned information for a different email address (jarrett@blazeverify.com) instead of info@techcompany.org. This suggests either an API error or a limitation in the service. Therefore, we cannot confirm the validity of info@techcompany.org based on these results.\n\n### support@quickmail.co\n**Tool Used: Email Existence Validator (MX Records)**\nThe tool returned MX records with an unusual value: `[[0, '.']]`. This is not a standard MX record format and may indicate an error in the API response or that the domain has an unusual configuration. We cannot conclusively confirm the mail server accept-mail status for support@quickmail.co based on these results.\n\n### marketing@tempinbox.me\n**Tools Used: Email Existence Validator & Alpha Email Verification**\nBoth tools indicate that marketing@tempinbox.me is **not a disposable email address**. According to the verification results, this email does not appear to be a temporary/throwaway address.\n\n## Domain Verification\n\n### tempinbox.me (Disposable Domain Check)\n**Tool Used: fast Email verifier**\nThe tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if tempinbox.me is a disposable domain. This could mean either the domain is not in their database of disposable domains, or the API encountered an error. No alternative domain was suggested.\n\n### quickmail.co (Role Account Check)\n**Tool Used: fast Email verifier**\nThe tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking for role accounts associated with quickmail.co. This result is inconclusive and doesn't allow us to determine if support@quickmail.co is a role/team inbox.\n\n### techcompany.org (Domain Availability)\n**Tool Used: fast Email verifier**\nThe tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if techcompany.org is available. This result is inconclusive and doesn't allow us to determine if the domain is available or already taken.\n\n## Additional Information\n\n### Email API Check\n**Tool Used: Email API**\nThe tool generated a fake business email (christopher.mills@peck.biz) with the job title \"Learning disability nurse\". This doesn't directly address any of your verification requests but provides a sample of the Email API's functionality.\n\n### Website Email Extraction\n**Tool Used: Get emails from url**\nFrom https://www.saascompetitor.com, only one email address was extracted: support@rapidapi.com. This suggests either the website has limited public contact information or the tool has limitations in extracting all available emails.\n\n## Summary\nMany of the verification checks returned inconclusive or error results. We can only confirm that marketing@tempinbox.me is not flagged as a disposable email by two different verification tools. The other checks (info@techcompany.org validity, support@quickmail.co accept-mail status, tempinbox.me disposable status, role account verification, and domain availability) all returned either errors or inconclusive results.

This appears to be an error in the tool's response, as it didn't verify the requested email. The tool shows this unrelated email as deliverable with a perfect score of 100, but this doesn't answer your query about john.smith@gmail.com.\n\n### 2. sarah.jones@tempmail.org Check\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool reported that sarah.jones@tempmail.org is **not a disposable email** (disposable: false). However, this contradicts what we would expect for a tempmail.org address, which is typically considered a disposable email domain. This result may be unreliable.\n\n### 3. contact@acme-corp.com Check\nThe Email Existence Validator confirmed that contact@acme-corp.com is **not a disposable or temporary email address** (disposable: false). This appears to be a legitimate business email address.\n\n### 4. info@startup.io Verification\nThe Email Address Validator returned an error: \"API doesn't exists\". Therefore, we couldn't verify the validity and deliverability of info@startup.io.\n\n### 5. support@quickmail.net Mail Server Status\nThe Email Existence Validator successfully retrieved MX records for support@quickmail.net, showing that it uses Proton Mail servers:\n- Primary MX: mail.protonmail.ch (priority 10)\n- Secondary MX: mailsec.protonmail.ch (priority 20)\n\nThis indicates the domain has valid mail servers configured, but doesn't confirm if the specific email address accepts mail.\n\n## Domain Checks\n\n### 1. tempmail.org Domain Check\nThe fast Email verifier tool returned a \"Service Suspended\" error when attempting to check if tempmail.org is a disposable domain. No alternative domain was suggested due to the service failure.\n\n### 2. Email API Check\nThe Email API generated a fake business email: christopher.mills@peck.biz with job title \"Learning disability nurse\". This doesn't directly address your query about checking if a specific domain is disposable.\n\n### 3. startup.io Domain Availability\nThe fast Email verifier returned \"Not Found\" when checking startup.io availability. This response is ambiguous and doesn't clearly indicate whether the domain is available or taken.\n\n### 4. RapidAPI Contact Emails\nThe Get emails from url tool successfully extracted one public contact email from https://rapidapi.com:\n- support@rapidapi.com\n\n## Summary\nThe tools provided partial or problematic results for most of your queries. Several tools returned errors or unexpected results, and in one case (john.smith@gmail.com), the tool returned information for an entirely different email address. The only clearly successful operations were confirming contact@acme-corp.com is not disposable, retrieving MX records for support@quickmail.net, and extracting support@rapidapi.com from the RapidAPI website."

This contradicts what might be expected from the domain name, which suggests a temporary mail service.\n\n2. **marketing@techcorp.com**: Email Existence Validator confirmed this is NOT a disposable email address (checked on September 08, 2025).\n\n3. **techstartup.com domain**: The fast Email verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" when attempting to check if this is a disposable domain. No alternative domain suggestion was provided due to this error.\n\n## Email Validity and Deliverability\n\n1. **john.doe@gmail.com**: The Blaze Verify tool did not actually check this address. Instead, it returned information for a different email (jarrett@blazeverify.com), which appears to be a sample or default response. The tool indicated this sample email is:\n   - State: Deliverable\n   - Score: 100\n   - Not a role account\n   - Not disposable\n   - Not from a free provider (which contradicts what we know about Gmail)\n\n2. **info@techstartup.com**: The SMTP check using fast Email verifier returned \"Not Found\", suggesting either an error in the API call or that the domain's email server could not be verified.\n\n## Role Account Checks\n\n1. **gmail.com domain**: The fast Email verifier confirmed that \"gmail.com is not a RoleAccount domain\", meaning Gmail addresses are typically personal rather than role-based.\n\n## Email Extraction\n\n1. **From RapidAPI website**: The Get emails from url tool found one email address: support@rapidapi.com\n\n## Additional Information\n\n1. **Email API sample**: Generated a fake business email for testing purposes: christopher.mills@peck.biz (Learning disability nurse)\n\n2. **Email Existence Validator supported domains**: The tool provided a list of supported email domains including gmail.com, outlook.com, hotmail.com, yahoo.com, aol.com, rediffmail.com, proton.me, protonmail.com, icloud.com, me.com, and mac.com.\n\n## Limitations and Errors\n\nSeveral tools returned incomplete or error responses:\n- The Blaze Verify tool returned information for a different email than requested\n- Two fast Email verifier checks returned \"Not Found\" errors\n- Some checks may have been missed or not properly executed based on the query"

Instead of verifying john.doe@gmail.com, the tool returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com. This suggests an error in the API response or a limitation in the test environment. The returned email shows as 'deliverable' with a score of 100, but this is not relevant to the requested email address.\n\n### 2. sarah.tech@outlook.com\nSimilar to the previous verification, the Blaze Verify tool returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com instead of sarah.tech@outlook.com. This indicates the same error or limitation as above.\n\n### 3. info@techcompany.org\nThe Email Validation_v3 tool returned an error message: \"You are not subscribed to this API.\" Therefore, we could not verify the validity or deliverability of this email address.\n\n### 4. support@tempmail.net\nThe Email Existence Validator tool confirmed that support@tempmail.net is indeed a disposable/temporary email address. Result status: disposable = True.\n\n### 5. contact@startupinc.com\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool confirmed that contact@startupinc.com is NOT a disposable email address. Result: disposable = False.\n\n## Domain Analysis\n\n### 1. tempmail.net\nThe fast Email verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if tempmail.net is a disposable domain. This contradicts the earlier finding that support@tempmail.net is disposable. This inconsistency suggests either a limitation in the tool or incomplete data.\n\n### 2. techcompany.org\nThe fast Email verifier FreeDomain tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking the availability of techcompany.org. This result is inconclusive and doesn't clearly indicate whether the domain is available or taken.\n\n## Additional Information\n\n### Email API Test\nThe Email API generated a fake business email: christopher.mills@peck.biz with the job title \"Learning disability nurse\". This appears to be functioning correctly but doesn't directly address the verification requests.\n\n### Website Email Extraction\nThe Get emails from url tool extracted only one email from https://techinnovators.com: support@rapidapi.com. This suggests either the website has limited public email addresses or the tool has limited extraction capabilities.\n\n### GetTempMail Test\nThe GetTempMail tool successfully created a temporary email address: campaign-test@gettempmail.com.\n\n## Summary\nDue to several tool limitations and errors, we could not fully verify all the requested email addresses. We confirmed that support@tempmail.net is a disposable email address and contact@startupinc.com is not disposable. The other verification requests returned either errors or inconsistent results. For a complete deliverability analysis, I recommend retrying with alternative verification tools or services."

The tool returned:\n```\n{'disposable': True}\n```\nThis indicates that mailinator.com is a known temporary/disposable email service provider.\n\n## Domain Availability Check\nWhen checking the availability of mailinator.com using the Fast Email Verifier tool, the result was \"Not Found\". This response is incomplete or potentially an error, as it doesn't clearly indicate whether the domain is available or already registered. Based on the disposable email check and MX records check, mailinator.com appears to be an active domain, but this specific tool did not provide conclusive information about domain availability.\n\n## Mail Server Status Check\nThe Email Existence Validator tool successfully retrieved MX records for tempuser@mailinator.com, showing:\n```\n{'status': 'ok', 'mx': [[1, 'mail.mailinator.com.'], [1, 'mail2.mailinator.com.']], 'datetime': 'August 20, 2025 18:25:04'}\n```\nThis confirms that the domain has valid mail exchange servers configured (mail.mailinator.com and mail2.mailinator.com), both with priority 1. The 'ok' status suggests that the mail servers are properly configured to potentially accept mail.\n\n## Summary\n- tempuser@mailinator.com is a disposable email address\n- Domain availability check was inconclusive, but mailinator.com appears to be an active domain\n- Mail servers for mailinator.com are properly configured with two MX records, suggesting the domain can accept mail"

The tool returned verification results, but for a completely different email address (jarrett@blazeverify.com) rather than the requested tempmail123@gettempmail.com. The verification shows:\n\n- State: Deliverable\n- Disposable: False\n- Score: 100\n- Domain: blazeverify.com (not gettempmail.com)\n\nThis result is not relevant to your query as it verified the wrong email address.\n\n## Disposable Domain Check\nThe attempt to check if gettempmail.com is a disposable domain returned \"Not Found\". The tool was unable to provide information about whether gettempmail.com is a disposable domain or suggest alternatives.\n\n## Domain Availability Check\nThe domain availability check for gettempmail.com also returned \"Not Found\". The tool was unable to determine whether gettempmail.com is available for registration or already taken.\n\n## Summary\nI was able to create the email tempmail123@gettempmail.com, but the verification process returned results for a different email address entirely. The tools failed to provide information about whether gettempmail.com is a disposable domain or its registration status. Due to these limitations and errors, I cannot provide a complete assessment of the deliverability of tempmail123@gettempmail.com or the status of the gettempmail.com domain."

This appears to be an error in the tool's response.\n\n7. **Second Validity Check**:\nThe Email Address Validator returned \"API doesn't exists\" - indicating this tool is not functioning properly.\n\nIn summary, we can confirm that john.smith@acmetech.com is not a disposable email and the domain has properly configured mail servers using Google's infrastructure.

Alpha Email Verification clearly identified it as disposable (returned: {\"disposable\": true})\n2. Email Existence Validator also confirmed it as disposable (returned: {\"disposable\": true})\n\nThis consistently indicates gamer2023@gettempmail.com is a temporary/throwaway address.\n\n## Domain Availability and Additional Checks\nSeveral tools returned \"Not Found\" responses when attempting to check:\n- Domain availability for gettempmail.com\n- Role account status\n- Disposable domain classification and alternatives\n- Server-level SMTP reachability\n\nThese \"Not Found\" responses likely indicate limitations in the tools' ability to process this domain rather than definitive results about the domain's status.\n\n## Email Validation Attempt\nThe Email Validation_v3 tool returned an error: \"You are not subscribed to this API\" - preventing a complete validation check.\n\n## Summary\nThe email address gamer2023@gettempmail.com:\n- Is confirmed as a disposable/temporary email address\n- Has valid MX records configured\n- Is associated with a known temporary email service (GetTempMail)\n- Should be flagged as problematic for list hygiene purposes\n\nFor maintaining good email list hygiene, this address should be rejected as it is definitively a disposable email address that would likely lead to deliverability issues or represent a non-committed user."

This tool did not provide any validation information for the target email address testuser@gettempmail.com.\n\n## GetTempMail Check\nThe GetTempMail tool successfully confirmed the existence of testuser@gettempmail.com as a temporary email address. The tool returned the same address that was provided, indicating it is a valid temporary email in their system.\n\n## Mail Server Accept-Mail Status\nThe Email Existence Validator's MX Records check showed that gettempmail.com has valid MX records with the primary mail server being mail.gettempmail.com (priority 0). This indicates the domain is configured to receive email.\n\n## Email Validity and Deliverability\nThe Easy Email Validation tool confirmed that testuser@gettempmail.com:\n- Is valid in format\n- Has a domain (gettempmail.com) with valid MX records\n- Is identified as a disposable email address\n\n## Temporary/Throwaway Status\nMultiple tools confirmed that testuser@gettempmail.com is a disposable/temporary email address:\n- Email Existence Validator explicitly reported it as disposable\n- Easy Email Validation also flagged it as disposable\n\n## Server-Level Reachability\nThe fast Email verifier SMTP check returned \"Not Found\" when attempting to verify the SMTP configuration for testuser@gettempmail.com. This suggests potential deliverability issues at the server level.\n\n## Email Existence Validator Additional Information\nThe Email Existence Validator Help Page provided a list of supported email domains, but gettempmail.com was not among them. This indicates limited support for validating this specific domain through this service.\n\n## Disposable Domain Check and Alternatives\nThe fast Email verifier disposable domain check returned \"Not Found\" when attempting to verify if gettempmail.com is disposable and to suggest alternatives. This tool was unable to provide the requested information.\n\n## Summary\ntestuser@gettempmail.com is a valid email address format with proper MX records, but it is definitively identified as a disposable/temporary email address. Server-level reachability checks were inconclusive, with some tools unable to provide complete information. For business communications, this email should be treated as temporary and potentially unreliable for long-term correspondence."

The domain tempmail.org, despite its name suggesting temporary mail, does not appear to be flagged as disposable in their database of 180,000 disposable domains.\n\n3. **Verification for info@startup-hub.net**:\nThe Email Address Validator tool returned an error: \"API doesn't exists\". Therefore, I cannot provide information about the validity or deliverability of this email address.\n\n4. **Domain Check for gmial.com**:\nThe fast Email verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if gmial.com is a disposable domain.

The check returned a status of 'ok' with disposable: False, indicating this is likely a legitimate business email address.\n\n3. **Email API Check**:\n   The Email API tool was used, but it appears there was a misunderstanding in the request. Instead of checking an existing email, the tool generated a fake business email (christopher.mills@peck.biz) with the job title 'Learning disability nurse'. This doesn't provide information about any specific email address you wanted to check.\n\n4. **Domain Availability for marketingpro.io**:\n   The FreeDomain checker returned 'Not Found' for marketingpro.io.

The output shows information for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com' rather than the requested email address. This suggests either an error in the tool's response or a redirection issue. The tool indicates:\n- State: Deliverable\n- Score: 100\n- Not a disposable email\n- Not a role account\n- Domain uses Google's mail servers\n\nHowever, since the email address in the response doesn't match the requested address, this verification is unreliable for john.smith@tempmail.org.\n\n### sarah@gmail.com\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool confirmed:\n- Not a disposable email address\n- Gmail is a legitimate email provider\n\nThe tool provided limited information, only checking if the email is from a disposable domain without verifying if the specific address exists or is deliverable.\n\n## Website Email Extraction\n\n### https://www.competitor-analysis.com\nThe Get Emails tool extracted only one email address from the website:\n- support@rapidapi.com\n\nThis suggests either the website has limited public email addresses or the tool may have only captured API-related contact information rather than actual company contacts. The result appears to be related to the API provider rather than the target website.\n\n## Domain Checks\n\n### gmail.com\nThe Fast Email Verifier FreeDomain tool confirmed:\n- gmail.com is a free domain\n\nThis indicates gmail.com is already taken and is classified as a free email service provider.\n\n### Role/Team Inbox Check\nThe Role Account check for acmecorp.com returned \"Not Found\", indicating:\n- No role accounts were identified for this domain\n- The tool may have limitations in detecting all types of role accounts\n\n## Server-Level Checks\n\n### SMTP Check\nThe email Check SMTP tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking marketingteam@marketingteam.com. This indicates:\n- Either the server doesn't exist\n- Or the tool couldn't properly connect to verify the SMTP configuration\n\nNote that this check was performed for marketingteam.com rather than any of the previously mentioned domains.\n\n### Mail Server Status for contact@acmecorp.com\nThe Email Existence Validator successfully retrieved MX records:\n- Status: ok\n- MX Record: acmecorp-com.mail.protection.outlook.com (priority 0)\n- Date: September 08, 2025 23:04:46\n\nThis confirms that acmecorp.com has valid mail servers configured (using Microsoft Outlook protection), but doesn't specifically verify if contact@acmecorp.com will accept mail.\n\n## Summary\nThe deliverability review is incomplete due to several tool limitations and mismatches. The verification for john.smith@tempmail.org returned incorrect data. Sarah@gmail.com is not disposable but its deliverability wasn't fully verified. Website email extraction yielded only an API-related address. Gmail.com is confirmed as an existing free domain. No role accounts were found for acmecorp.com. The SMTP check was performed on an unrelated domain. Contact@acmecorp.com's domain has valid MX records using Microsoft's mail protection services, but specific mailbox acceptance wasn't confirmed."

Instead of verifying sarah.johnson@tempmail.org, it returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com. This suggests an error in the API response or configuration. The tool shows this email as 'deliverable' with a score of 100, but this is not relevant to your requested email address.\n\n### 2. michael.zhang@quickdomain.net\nThe Email Validation_v3 tool returned an error: \"You are not subscribed to this API.\" Therefore, I cannot provide verification results for this email address.\n\n### 3. elena.rodriguez@businessmail.com\nThe Email Address Validator tool returned an error: \"API doesn't exist.\" No verification data is available for this email address.\n\n### 4. ahmed.hassan@mailservice.io\nThe Easy Email Validation tool reports:\n- Valid format: Yes\n- Disposable: No\n- MX Record: No (This indicates potential deliverability issues as the domain lacks mail exchange records)\n\n### 5. priya.patel@fastcorp.org\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool reports:\n- Disposable: No\nThis tool only checked if the email domain is disposable and did not verify other aspects of email validity or deliverability.\n\n### 6. disposable.cc domain check\nThe fast Email verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if disposable.cc is a disposable domain. No alternative domain suggestions were provided due to the error.\n\n### 7. carlos.mendoza@enterprise-solutions.com\nThe Email Existence Validator tool reports:\n- Status: ok\n- MX: \"No MX Found\" - The domain enterprise-solutions.com does not have MX records\n- This indicates the domain is not configured to receive email, making the address undeliverable\n\n### 8. Server-level reachability check\nThe fast Email verifier tool attempted to check SMTP for natasha.ivanova@techmail.ru (not one of your requested addresses) and returned \"Not Found\". This appears to be an error in the tool execution as it checked a different email than those in your query.\n\n## Summary\nMost verification attempts were unsuccessful due to API errors or limitations. From the limited successful results:\n- ahmed.hassan@mailservice.io has valid format but lacks MX records, suggesting deliverability issues\n- priya.patel@fastcorp.org is not from a disposable domain\n- carlos.mendoza@enterprise-solutions.com is likely undeliverable due to missing MX records\n\nI recommend using a more reliable email verification service to properly validate these addresses, as most of the tools used here either failed or provided incomplete information."

Instead of verifying john.smith@tempmail.org, the tool returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com. This suggests a potential API limitation or error in the verification process. The returned email shows as deliverable with a score of 100, but this is not relevant to the requested email address.\n\n### 2. sarah.jones@gmail.com\nSimilar to the first verification, the Blaze Verify tool returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com instead of sarah.jones@gmail.com. This indicates the same API limitation or error occurred.\n\n### 3. contact@acme-corp.com\nAgain, the Blaze Verify tool returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com instead of contact@acme-corp.com, showing the same pattern of API limitation.\n\n### 4. customer.service@compny.com\nThe Easy Email Validation tool reports this email as:\n- Valid format: Yes\n- Domain: compny.com\n- Disposable: No\n- MX Record: No (indicating the domain cannot receive emails)\n\nThis suggests the email is properly formatted but likely undeliverable due to missing mail server records.\n\n## Email API Check\nThe Email API generated a fake business email for testing purposes: christopher.mills@peck.biz with the job title \"Learning disability nurse\".\n\n## Public Contact Emails from RapidAPI\nThe Get Emails tool successfully extracted one email address from the RapidAPI website:\n- support@rapidapi.com\n\n## Domain Checks\n\n### tempmail.org (Disposable Domain Check)\nThe fast Email verifier tool returned an error: \"Service Suspended\". Unable to determine if tempmail.org is a disposable domain or suggest alternatives.\n\n### gmail.com (Domain Availability)\nThe fast Email verifier tool confirms: \"gmail.com is a Free domain\", indicating it's a free email service provider and not available for registration.\n\n### acme-corp.com (Mail Server Status)\nThe Email Existence Validator reports: \"No MX Found\" for acme-corp.com, indicating this domain does not have mail exchange records configured and cannot receive emails.\n\n## Summary\nThe email verification tools showed significant limitations, with Blaze Verify consistently returning incorrect data. Only customer.service@compny.com was properly verified (though found to be likely undeliverable due to missing MX records). The domain checks revealed gmail.com is a free email domain, while acme-corp.com lacks mail server configuration. RapidAPI's public contact email was successfully extracted.

This is unexpected given the domain name 'tempmail.org' which typically indicates a temporary email service.\n\n### 2. john.smith@gmail.com\n**Tool Used**: Blaze Verify: Verify an email\n**Result**: The verification appears to have returned information for a different email address (jarrett@blazeverify.com) rather than the requested john.smith@gmail.com. This result is incorrect and cannot be used to determine the validity of john.smith@gmail.com.\n\n### 3. contact@ourcompany.com\n**Tool Used**: Email Address Validator: Validate Email Address\n**Result**: The tool returned an error: \"API doesn't exists\". No verification was performed.\n\n### 4. Email API Check\n**Tool Used**: Email API: Get Fake Email Address\n**Result**: The tool generated a fake business email: christopher.mills@peck.biz with job title \"Learning disability nurse\". This doesn't address the verification request but provides a sample fake email.\n\n### 5. info@acmecorp.com\n**Tool Used**: Email Existence Validator: Check for Disposable emails\n**Result**: The email was verified as NOT being disposable (disposable: false).

No verification was performed and no alternative was suggested.\n\n### 9.

    "final_answer": "I've analyzed the results from the tool execution to address your query about email verification and domain checks. Here's what I found:\n\n1. Email Extraction from techsummit.org:\nThe tool only found one email address: support@rapidapi.com. This appears to be related to the API service itself rather than actual contact emails from techsummit.org. This result is likely incomplete or misleading.\n\n2. Disposable Email Check for info@techsummit.org:\nThe check indicates that info@techsummit.org is NOT a disposable/throwaway email address (disposable: False).\n\n3. Email Validation for support@devcon.com:\nThe validation shows that support@devcon.com has valid format (valid: True), is not disposable (disposable: False), but interestingly has no MX record (mxRecord: False), which suggests potential deliverability issues despite the valid format.\n\n4. Email Validation for contact@innovatefest.net:\nThe tool returned an error message: \"API doesn't exists\". Therefore, I cannot verify the validity or deliverability of this address.\n\n5. Email API Check:\nThis tool generated a random fake business email (christopher.mills@peck.biz) rather than performing any verification on the requested addresses.\n\n6. MX Records Check for info@techsummit.org:\nThe tool returned unusual MX record data: [[0, '.']]. This non-standard response suggests potential issues with the mail server configuration or with the API's ability to retrieve proper MX records.\n\n7. Domain Availability Check for techsummit.org:\nThe tool returned \"Not Found\", which is ambiguous. It could mean either the domain is not registered (available) or that the tool failed to retrieve information.\n\n8. Role Account Check for devcon.com:\nThe tool returned \"Not Found\", which could mean either no role accounts were detected or the tool failed to perform the check properly.\n\n9. SMTP Check for contact@innovatefest.net:\nThe tool returned \"Not Found\", which could indicate either email server configuration issues or a failure of the tool itself.\n\nIn summary, the tools provided limited and sometimes ambiguous information. While info@techsummit.org appears to be a legitimate (non-disposable) email address, its mail server configuration seems unusual. The support@devcon.com address has valid format but lacks proper MX records for deliverability. For contact@innovatefest.net, most verification attempts failed or returned errors. Several tools returned \"Not Found\" responses, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about domain availability and server configurations."

This appears to be a tool error or limitation, as it did not verify the requested address. The tool returned information about a deliverable email with 100% score, but for the wrong address.\n\n2. **sales@quickbiz.net**: Email Existence Validator successfully retrieved MX records for this domain, showing:\n   - MX records present with priorities 10, 10, and 50\n   - Server names: mx01.biz.comcast.net, mx02.biz.comcast.net, mx03.biz.comcast.net\n   - This suggests the mail server is properly configured to receive email.\n\n## Email API Test\n\n- The Email API generated a fake business email: **christopher.mills@peck.biz** with job title \"Learning disability nurse\". This was likely just a demonstration of the API functionality.\n\n## Website Email Extraction\n\n- From https://www.competitor-analysis.com, only one email was extracted: **support@rapidapi.com**. This suggests either the website has limited public contact information or the tool has limited extraction capabilities.\n\n## Failed or Limited Checks\n\nSeveral tools returned \"Not Found\" results:\n- Role account check for techcorp.com\n- Domain availability check for enterprise.net\n- Disposable domain check for disposable.cc\n- SMTP configuration check for contact@startup.io\n\nThese failures limit our ability to provide complete information on these queries.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe verification results are incomplete due to several tool limitations and errors. Most notably, the verification for marketing@techcorp.com returned results for an entirely different email address, and four of the requested checks returned no results at all. The checks that did work provided some useful information about email server configurations and disposable status, but a comprehensive hygiene assessment would require additional verification with more reliable tools."

However, I should note that the verification date shown (September 08, 2025) appears to be incorrect as it's in the future, which raises some questions about the reliability of this particular result.\n\n2. **Validity Check for marketing@cloudservices.net**:\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned information for a completely different email address (jarrett@blazeverify.com) rather than the requested marketing@cloudservices.net. This appears to be an error in the tool's response or possibly a sample response. Therefore, we don't have valid verification data for marketing@cloudservices.net.\n\n3. **Domain Availability for fastmail-offers.com**:\nThe Fast Email verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" for fastmail-offers.com.

However, the limited response makes it difficult to be completely certain.\n\nIn summary, the verification tasks were only partially successful, with questionable results for the first email, incorrect data for the second email, and limited information for the domain availability check."

Domain Availability Check for gmail.com\nThe 'Fast Email Verifier: FreeDomain' tool confirmed that gmail.com is a free domain. The exact response was: 'gmail.com is a Free domain'.

The specific message was: 'No MX Found The DNS response does not contain an answer to the question: company.com. IN MX'. This indicates that the domain company.com does not have mail servers configured to receive email, meaning mywork@company.com would not be able to receive messages.\n\n## 4.

Instead, it returned information for a different email (jarrett@blazeverify.com), which appears to be a sample response or default output. Therefore, we have no validation data for newsletter@temp-mail.org.\n\n### 3. Role/Team Inbox Check for gmail.com\n**Tool Used**: fast Email verifier (Role Account)\n**Result**: The tool checked gmail.com instead of a specific email address and reported: \"gmail.com is not a RoleAccount domain\". This doesn't address the original request to check whether specific addresses are role/team inboxes.\n\n### 4. info@business-domain.com\n**Tool Used**: Easy Email Validation\n**Result**: \n- Valid format: Yes\n- Domain: business-domain.com\n- Disposable: No\n- MX Record: No (This suggests potential deliverability issues as the domain lacks mail exchange records)\n\n### 5. mailinator.com Domain Check\n**Tool Used**: fast Email verifier (FreeDomain)\n**Result**: \"Not Found\" - The tool response is unclear, but this likely means either the tool failed to provide a result or the domain check was inconclusive.\n\n### 6. Email API Check\n**Tool Used**: Email API (Get Fake Email Address)\n**Result**: The tool generated a fake email address (christopher.mills@peck.biz) with job title \"Learning disability nurse\" instead of performing the requested API check.\n\n## Summary\nThe hygiene check was largely unsuccessful due to tool limitations and errors. We were only able to partially verify one email address (info@business-domain.com), which appears valid in format but may have deliverability issues due to missing MX records. The other requested checks either returned errors, checked different addresses than requested, or performed entirely different functions than needed. A more comprehensive email hygiene check would require properly functioning tools with appropriate subscriptions."

The check was performed on August 20, 2025, and returned a clear disposable status of 'True'.\n\n### newsletter@gmail.com\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool confirms that **newsletter@gmail.com is NOT a disposable email address**. Gmail is a legitimate email service provider, and this address does not present any disposability concerns.\n\n### updates@yahoo.com\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned information, but it appears the verification was performed on a different email address than requested. The tool returned results for **jarrett@blazeverify.com** instead of updates@yahoo.com. This is a limitation in the tool execution that prevents us from properly verifying the requested address. The substituted email was marked as deliverable with a score of 100, but this information is not relevant to your query about updates@yahoo.com.\n\n## Temporary Email Service Checks\n\n### GetTempMail Check\nThe GetTempMail tool was used to create a temporary email address: **cleanup@gettempmail.com**. This confirms that GetTempMail is a functioning temporary email service that can generate disposable addresses.\n\n### Email API Check\nThe Email API tool generated a fake business email: **christopher.mills@peck.biz** with the job title \"Learning disability nurse\". This demonstrates the Email API's capability to create synthetic email addresses for testing purposes.\n\n## Mail Server Status Check\n\n### admin@acmetech.com\nThe Email Existence Validator retrieved MX records for acmetech.com, showing that the domain uses Google's mail servers (aspmx.l.google.com as primary MX with priority 1, and several alternate servers). This indicates that acmetech.com has properly configured mail servers that can receive email. The presence of valid MX records suggests the mail server would accept mail for admin@acmetech.com, though a direct SMTP test would provide more definitive confirmation.\n\n## Summary\n- support@mailinator.com: Confirmed disposable email address\n- newsletter@gmail.com: Legitimate, non-disposable email address\n- updates@yahoo.com: Verification failed (tool returned data for a different email)\n- GetTempMail: Successfully created a temporary email address\n- Email API: Successfully generated a fake business email\n- admin@acmetech.com: Has valid MX records pointing to Google's mail servers, suggesting mail acceptance capability"

This is somewhat surprising given the domain name.\n\n### 2. newsletter@updates.com\nThe Email Existence Validator confirms that newsletter@updates.com is **NOT a disposable or temporary email address**. The check was performed on September 08, 2025.\n\n### 3. quickmail.xyz\nThe fast Email verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if quickmail.xyz is a disposable domain. This means **no conclusive information** was obtained about this domain, and no alternative domain was suggested. This represents a limitation in the tool's response.\n\n## Role/Team Inbox Check\n\nThe fast Email verifier Role Account check was performed on **gmail.com** instead of the requested domains. The result shows that \"gmail.com is not a RoleAccount domain.\" However, this doesn't address the original query about checking if support/sales addresses are role/team inboxes.\n\n## Domain Availability Check\n\nThe fast Email verifier FreeDomain tool confirms that **yahoo.com is a free domain**, meaning it's already taken and in use (not available for registration).\n\n## Additional Tool Results\n\n### Email API\nThe Email API generated a fake business email: **christopher.mills@peck.biz** with job title \"Learning disability nurse.\" This doesn't directly address any part of the original query.\n\n### Email Existence Validator Help\nThe Email Existence Validator provided a list of supported email domains: gmail.com, outlook.com, hotmail.com, yahoo.com, aol.com, rediffmail.com, proton.me, protonmail.com, icloud.com, me.com, and mac.com. Documentation is available at https://rapidapi.com/deveshkumarsingh75/api/email-existence-validator/.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe hygiene checks were partially completed with some limitations:\n- support@tempmail.org is not flagged as disposable\n- newsletter@updates.com is not a temporary/throwaway address\n- No conclusive information about quickmail.xyz\n- The role/team inbox check was performed on the wrong domain\n- yahoo.com is confirmed as taken/in use\n- Some tool calls didn't directly address the requested checks"

The result shows: `{\"RoleAccount\": \"gmail.com is not a RoleAccount domain\"}`. This doesn't address the original query about support/sales addresses.\n\n### yahoo.com Domain Availability\nThe FreeDomain check confirms that **yahoo.com is a free domain** (meaning it's an established free email service provider, not that it's available for registration): `{\"FreeDomain\": \"yahoo.com is a Free domain\"}`.\n\n## Email API Check\nThe Email API generated a fake business email: `{\"email\": \"christopher.mills@peck.biz\", \"job_title\": \"Learning disability nurse\"}`. This doesn't directly address the query about checking an Email API.\n\n## Website Email Extraction\nThe Get emails from url tool extracted one email from https://mycompany.org: **support@rapidapi.com**. Note that this appears to be the RapidAPI support email rather than emails specific to \"mycompany.org\".\n\n## Summary\nThe verification results are mixed and incomplete. We confirmed updates@10minutemail.com is disposable, support@tempmail.org is reportedly not disposable (though this seems counterintuitive), and yahoo.com is a free email domain.

This indicates the tool was unable to provide information about this domain. Note that tempmail.net is actually a known disposable email domain, but the tool failed to confirm this. No alternative domain was suggested due to the tool limitation.\n\n### dailydeals.com (Domain Availability)\nThe tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking the availability of dailydeals.com. This means the tool was unable to determine whether this domain is available or already taken. This represents a limitation in the tool's functionality.\n\n## Email Address Checks\n\n### Role/Team Inbox Check\nThe tool returned a service suspension message when attempting to check for role accounts. This check was unsuccessful due to service unavailability.\n\n### Server-level Reachability Check\nThe attempt to perform a server-level reachability check for contact@business-updates.org returned \"Not Found,\" indicating the tool was unable to complete this verification.\n\n### Mail Server Status for alerts@quickmail.co\nThe MX Records check for alerts@quickmail.co returned unusual results. The MX record shows only \"[0, '.']\" which appears to be incomplete or invalid data. This suggests potential deliverability issues with this domain.\n\n### Temporary/Throwaway Address Check for hello@flash-offers.net\nThe disposable email check indicates that hello@flash-offers.net is NOT a disposable or temporary email address (disposable: False).\n\n### Validity Check for admin@newsletter-weekly.com\nThe validation results show:\n- Email is valid in format\n- Domain is not disposable\n- However, no MX record was found (mxRecord: False), which indicates emails sent to this address will not be deliverable\n\n### Validity Check for updates@infoletters.org\nThe verification tool returned unexpected results, showing information for a completely different email address (jarrett@blazeverify.com) rather than the requested address. This appears to be an error in the tool's response or possibly a default/sample response.\n\n## Summary\nThe deliverability review is incomplete due to multiple tool failures and limitations. Several checks returned \"Not Found\" or error messages, and one check returned data for an unrelated email address. Based on the limited successful results, hello@flash-offers.net appears to be a legitimate (non-disposable) address, while admin@newsletter-weekly.com has format validity but lacks MX records for actual delivery. Further verification with more reliable tools is strongly recommended before making final deliverability determinations."

However, this contradicts common knowledge that tempmail.org is typically a disposable email service, so this result may be questionable.\n\n- **support@mailinator.com**: The Email Existence Validator confirmed this is a disposable/temporary email address (`\"disposable\": true`), as expected since Mailinator is a known temporary email service.\n\n## Email Validity and Deliverability Checks\n- **marketing@gmail.com**: The Blaze Verify tool returned unexpected results. Instead of checking marketing@gmail.com, it appears to have returned information for a different email (jarrett@blazeverify.com). The tool output shows this email as deliverable, but this doesn't answer the original query about marketing@gmail.com.\n\n- **promotions@example.com**: The Email Address Validator returned an error message: \"API doesn't exists\". Therefore, I cannot verify the validity or deliverability of this address.\n\n- **updates@yahoo.com**: The Email Existence Validator retrieved MX records for this domain, showing three valid mail servers for yahoo.com:\n  * mta5.am0.yahoodns.net (priority 1)\n  * mta7.am0.yahoodns.net (priority 1)\n  * mta6.am0.yahoodns.net (priority 1)\n  \n  This confirms the domain has proper mail server configuration, but doesn't specifically verify if the email address itself accepts mail.\n\n## Website Email Extraction\n- **https://example.com**: The Get Emails from URL tool found no email addresses on this website (returned an empty array).\n\n## GetTempMail Check\n- **unsubscribe-test@gettempmail.com**: The GetTempMail tool successfully created this temporary email address, confirming that gettempmail.com is a disposable email service provider.\n\n## Summary\nSeveral tools returned incomplete, unexpected, or error results. The checks confirmed that gmail.com is taken, support@mailinator.com is disposable, and updates@yahoo.com has valid MX records. The example.com website doesn't contain public email addresses. GetTempMail was confirmed as a disposable email service. However, we couldn't properly verify tempmail.org's status, marketing@gmail.com's validity, or promotions@example.com's deliverability due to tool limitations or errors."

The domain tempmail.org, despite its name suggesting a temporary mail service, was not flagged as disposable in the verification database.\n\n## newsletter@mailinator.com\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned results, but there appears to be a discrepancy in the output. The verification was performed on **jarrett@blazeverify.com** instead of the requested newsletter@mailinator.com. This result is not relevant to our query and should be disregarded. We cannot make any determination about newsletter@mailinator.com from this data.\n\n## support@company.com\nThe Email Existence Validator tool reported that there are **no MX records found** for company.com. The DNS response does not contain an answer to the MX record query for company.com. This suggests that the domain is not properly configured to receive email, making support@company.com likely undeliverable.\n\n## info@business.net\nThe Email Address Validator tool returned an error message: \"API doesn't exists\". We cannot verify the validity or deliverability of info@business.net due to this tool failure.\n\n## quickmail.io domain check\nThe fast Email verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if quickmail.io is a disposable domain. This could mean either the service couldn't determine the status or the API call failed. We cannot provide a definitive answer about quickmail.io or suggest alternatives.\n\n## Role account check\nThe attempt to check role accounts for news-letter.com (not the requested domain) returned \"Not Found\". This tool execution did not address the original request to check whether support/sales addresses are role/team inboxes.\n\n## domain.org availability\nThe fast Email verifier FreeDomain tool returned an HTML error page indicating the service has been suspended. We cannot determine whether domain.org is available or already taken.\n\n## team@disposable-mail.com\nThe Email Existence Validator confirmed that team@disposable-mail.com is a **disposable email address**. This means it's likely a temporary or throwaway address not suitable for important communications.\n\n## hello@gmail.com\nThe Email Validation_v3 tool returned an error: \"You are not subscribed to this API.\" We cannot verify the validity or deliverability of hello@gmail.com.\n\n## Server-level reachability check\nThe fast Email verifier SMTP check for admin@corporate.biz (not matching any requested email) returned \"Not Found\". The server-level reachability check was not successfully performed for any of the requested addresses.\n\n# Summary\nOf all the email addresses and domains checked, we were only able to definitively determine that marketing@tempmail.org is not a disposable email address and that team@disposable-mail.com is a disposable email address. For all other queries, the tools either returned errors, irrelevant information, or no information at all.
