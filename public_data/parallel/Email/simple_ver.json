However, the tool didn't explicitly confirm whether this is a disposable email service, though the domain name 'tempmail.org' strongly suggests it is likely a temporary email provider.\n\n2) **SMTP Configuration Check for marketing@cloudflare.com**:\nThe Email Check SMTP tool returned a 'Not Found' result when attempting to verify the SMTP configuration for marketing@cloudflare.com. This could indicate several possibilities: either the SMTP server for cloudflare.com isn't properly configured, the specific username 'marketing' doesn't exist, or the tool encountered limitations when attempting to verify this address. Without additional information, we cannot conclusively determine the status of this email address's SMTP configuration.\n\n3) **Message Retrieval for test@gettempmail.com**:\nThe GetTempMail tool encountered a timeout error when attempting to fetch messages from test@gettempmail.com. The specific error was: 'The request to the API has timed out. Please try again later, or if the issue persists, please contact the API provider.' This means we were unable to retrieve any messages from this account to evaluate before deactivation.\n\nIn summary, your email list cleanup has yielded partial results. We confirmed MX record existence for tempmail.org but couldn't definitively verify its disposable status (though the name suggests it is). The SMTP verification for the cloudflare.com address was inconclusive, and we couldn't retrieve any messages from the gettempmail.com account due to a timeout error.

Here are the detailed results for each address:\n\n## 1. john.smith@tempmail.org\n\nThe Fast Email Verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking the domain tempmail.org. This suggests the domain may not be properly registered or accessible, making this email address potentially invalid. This address should be flagged for removal.\n\n## 2. sarah.jones@gmail.com\n\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned results, but there appears to be a discrepancy in the verification. The output shows information for a different email address (jarrett@blazeverify.com) rather than the requested sarah.jones@gmail.com. This suggests the tool may have encountered an error or returned sample data instead of actual verification results. Without proper verification data for sarah.jones@gmail.com, we cannot make a determination about this address.\n\n## 3. info@acmecompany.com\n\nThe Email Existence Validator found no MX records for the acmecompany.com domain. The specific error was: \"No MX Found The DNS response does not contain an answer to the question: acmecompany.com. IN MX\". Without valid MX records, the domain cannot receive emails, making this address undeliverable. This address should be flagged for removal.\n\n## 4. ceo@startupfirm.net\n\nThe Email Existence Validator reported that the domain startupfirm.net does not exist: \"No MX Found The DNS query name does not exist: startupfirm.net\". This means the domain itself is not registered or active, making this email address invalid. This address should be flagged for removal.\n\n## Summary\n\nBased on the verification results, I recommend removing the following addresses from your mailing list:\n- john.smith@tempmail.org (domain verification failed)\n- info@acmecompany.com (no MX records found)\n- ceo@startupfirm.net (domain does not exist)\n\nFor sarah.jones@gmail.com, the verification returned inconsistent results, so additional verification is recommended before making a decision about this address.",

This suggests the tool may be in demo mode or experiencing an issue.\n\n## Results by Email Address\n\n1. **john.smith@gmail.com**: Unable to verify due to tool limitations.\n\n2. **support@techcorp.net**: Unable to verify due to tool limitations. Note that this appears to be a role-based email address (starting with \"support@\"), which typically indicates a general inbox rather than an individual.\n\n3. **info@tempmail.org**: Unable to verify due to tool limitations. The domain \"tempmail.org\" is commonly associated with disposable email services, though this wasn't confirmed by our tools.\n\n4. **sarah.jones@yahooo.com**: The domain verification tool returned \"Not Found\" for \"yahooo.com\", suggesting this is likely a misspelled domain. The correct domain is probably \"yahoo.com\" (with two 'o's instead of three).\n\n5. **contact@startupbiz.co**: The MX record check returned \"No MX Found\", indicating this domain doesn't have mail exchange servers configured. This means the domain cannot receive emails, making this address invalid.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. Remove **sarah.jones@yahooo.com** (misspelled domain) and **contact@startupbiz.co** (invalid domain) from your mailing list.\n2. Consider removing **info@tempmail.org** as it's likely a disposable email address.\n3. Be cautious with **support@techcorp.net** as role-based addresses may have different engagement patterns.\n4. Re-verify all addresses with a functioning verification service before sending your newsletter.\n\nFor more accurate results, I recommend using a different email verification service or ensuring your current service is properly configured.",

I cannot provide a definitive answer about this domain's status.\n\n## Email Address Validation\n\n1. **marketing@tempmail.org**: The Alpha Email Verification tool indicates this email is NOT disposable (returned `{\"disposable\": False}`).

The complete results show:\n   - Valid: Yes\n   - Domain: gmail.com\n   - Disposable: No\n   - MX Record: Yes\n\n3. **newsletter@mailinator.com**: No validation results were provided for this specific email address as none of the tools successfully checked it.\n\n## Website Email Scan\n\nWhen scanning the company website 'acmecorp.com' for publicly exposed email addresses, the tool found only one email address:\n- support@rapidapi.com\n\nThis appears to be related to the API service itself rather than an actual email from your company website. The scan may not have been able to access all pages of your website or the website might not have email addresses publicly displayed in a format the tool could detect.\n\n## Summary\n\nBased on the available information:\n- Gmail.com is confirmed as a legitimate, non-disposable email domain\n- The status of tempmail.org and mailinator.com could not be definitively determined due to tool errors\n- client.support@gmail.com is a valid, non-disposable email address\n- The website scan did not return any company-specific email addresses\n\nI recommend using additional verification tools or services to complete your mailing list cleanup, particularly for validating tempmail.org and mailinator.com domains, and for finding any additional email addresses on your company website.",

The tool returned:\n   - Status: ok\n   - MX Record: [0, 'global-enterprise.com.']\n   - Date: August 19, 2025 06:47:44\n   This confirms that the domain has the necessary infrastructure to receive emails, though it appears the domain is using itself as the mail exchanger.\n\n3. **Disposable Email Check for random-user-123@tempmail.org**:\n   Contrary to what the domain name might suggest, this email address is NOT identified as disposable according to the validation tool. Key findings:\n   - Disposable: False\n   - Domain: tempmail.org\n   - Domain Age: 2764 days (over 7 years old)\n   - MX Records: Present (mail.h-email.net with priority 1)\n   - Role Account: True (suggesting it's a functional/organizational account rather than personal)\n   - Spam: False\n\nIn summary: The global-enterprise.com domain has valid MX records and can receive email. The tempmail.org address is not flagged as disposable despite its name. Unfortunately, I couldn't validate lead.dev@innovatech.io due to an API error.",

This suggests either the tool failed to properly check this domain or the domain doesn't exist in their database. We cannot conclusively determine if tempmail.com is a disposable email provider based on this result.\n\n2. **gmail.com**: The Fast Email Verifier tool confirmed that 'gmail.com is a Free domain'. This correctly identifies Gmail as a free email provider.\n\n3. **acme-corp.org**: The Fast Email Verifier tool returned 'Not Found' for this domain. This likely means the tool couldn't determine if it's a free/disposable domain, which suggests it's probably a regular business domain rather than a free email service.\n\n## MX Record Verification\n\n1. **contact@client-project.com**: The Email Existence Validator found 'No MX Found' for this domain. The DNS response does not contain MX records for client-project.com, which means this domain is not properly configured to receive emails.\n\n2. **support@techpartner.net**: The Email Existence Validator returned MX records as '[[0, '.']]'. This unusual result suggests there might be an issue with the MX configuration for this domain or with the tool's response format.\n\n3. **info@consultant.org**: No results were provided for this email address as the tool wasn't executed for this domain.\n\n## SMTP Configuration Check\n\n**purchasing@newvendor.com**: The Fast Email Verifier returned 'Not Found' when checking SMTP configuration. This could mean either the tool failed to connect to the domain or the domain doesn't have proper SMTP configuration for the username 'purchasing'.\n\n## Fake Business Email Generation\n\nThe Email API successfully generated a fake business email for testing purposes:\n- Email: christopher.mills@peck.biz\n- Job Title: Learning disability nurse\n\n# Summary\n\nYour mailing list cleanup has yielded mixed results. Gmail.com is confirmed as a free email provider, while results for tempmail.com and acme-corp.org were inconclusive due to tool limitations. The MX record checks revealed that client-project.com lacks proper email configuration, and techpartner.net has unusual MX records that require further investigation.

Additionally, we couldn't verify MX records for this domain as the fast Email verifier tool returned a 'Service Suspended' error when attempting to check if the domain is disposable.\n\n**Recommendation:** Consider additional verification before keeping this address.\n\n## 2. john.smith@disposable-mail.com\n\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool confirmed this email is **disposable**. We couldn't verify MX records as the fast Email verifier tool returned 'Not Found' when checking the domain.\n\n**Recommendation:** Remove this email from your mailing list.\n\n## 3. marketing@company-domain.co\n\nThe Email Existence Validator tool reported **no MX records found** for this domain.

The tool shows verification for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com' instead of the requested 'info@quickmail.xyz'. This suggests either an error in the tool's response or a redirection issue.\n\n**Recommendation:** Re-verify this email address as the current results are inconclusive.\n\n## 5. contact@business-services.net\n\nSimilar to the previous email, the Blaze Verify tool returned results for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com' instead of 'contact@business-services.net', indicating a potential error in the verification process.\n\n**Recommendation:** Re-verify this email address as the current results are inconclusive.\n\n## Summary\n\nBased on the available information:\n- **Confirmed for removal:** john.smith@disposable-mail.com (disposable) and marketing@company-domain.co (invalid domain)\n- **Requires additional verification:** support@tempmail.org, info@quickmail.xyz, and contact@business-services.net\n\nThe tools provided incomplete or potentially erroneous information for several email addresses.

Instead of validating support@mailinator.com, it returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com. This suggests the tool may have malfunctioned or returned default/sample data.\n\n**Fast Email Verifier Tool**: When checking the mailinator.com domain, the service returned an error: \"Service Suspended\". This prevented us from confirming if mailinator.com is a disposable domain through this tool.\n\n## 2. info@gmail.com\n**Blaze Verify Tool**: Similar to the first email, this tool returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com instead of validating info@gmail.com. This indicates a consistent issue with the tool's functionality.\n\n## 3. contact@tempmail.net\n**Email Existence Validator**: Successfully verified this email.\n- **Disposable**: Yes (confirmed disposable email)\n- **Verification Date**: August 20, 2025 17:51:39\n\n## 4. help@yahoo.com\n**Email Existence Validator**: Successfully retrieved MX records.\n- **MX Records**: \n  - mta5.am0.yahoodns.net (priority: 1)\n  - mta7.am0.yahoodns.net (priority: 1)\n  - mta6.am0.yahoodns.net (priority: 1)\n- **Status**: Valid MX configuration\n\n## 5. admin@guerrillamail.com\n**Alpha Email Verification**: Successfully verified this email.\n- **Disposable**: Yes (confirmed disposable email)\n\n## 6. sales@protonmail.com\n**Blaze Verify Tool**: As with the previous attempts, this tool returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com instead of validating sales@protonmail.com, indicating the same issue persists.\n\n## 7. feedback@outlook.com\nNo verification results were returned for this email address from any of the tools.\n\n## 8. service@yopmail.com\n**Fast Email Verifier**: When checking the yopmail.com domain, the tool returned \"Not Found\". This response is inconclusive and doesn't clearly indicate whether the domain is disposable or has valid MX records.\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\nBased on the limited reliable data we received:\n\n1. **Confirmed Disposable Emails** (should be removed from your list):\n   - contact@tempmail.net\n   - admin@guerrillamail.com\n\n2. **Confirmed Valid Configuration**:\n   - help@yahoo.com (has proper MX records)\n\n3. **Inconclusive Results** (require additional verification):\n   - support@mailinator.com\n   - info@gmail.com\n   - sales@protonmail.com\n   - feedback@outlook.com\n   - service@yopmail.com\n\nI recommend running additional verification on the inconclusive emails using alternative tools, as the current results are either missing, erroneous, or incomplete for a comprehensive assessment.",

The empty result doesn't confirm whether the address is valid or disposable.\n\n## 7. sales@potentialclient.org\n**Tool Used**: fast Email verifier: email Check SMTP\n**Results**: \"Not Found\"\n\nThis suggests potential issues with this domain's email configuration, though the error message is ambiguous.\n\n## 8. help@mailservice.co\n**Tool Used**: Email Existence Validator: Help Page\n**Results**: This tool only returned documentation about the service, not validation results for the email.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nDue to significant limitations with the tools (subscription errors, API unavailability, and tools that don't perform the requested validations), I cannot provide a complete assessment of all email addresses.

This appears to be an error in the tool's response, as it didn't validate the actual email you provided. **This result is misleading and should be disregarded.**\n\n## 2. contact@disposable-mail.com\nThe Email Existence Validator confirmed this is a **disposable email address**:\n- Status: Disposable (True)\n- This email should be removed from your marketing list as it's likely temporary and won't provide long-term engagement.\n\n## 3. microsoft.com domain (for ceo@microsoft.com)\nThe Role Account verification tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking microsoft.com. This means:\n- The tool couldn't determine if ceo@microsoft.com is a role-based account\n- **Limited information available** for this address\n\n## 4. gmail.com domain (for admin@gmail.com)\nThe FreeDomain checker confirmed:\n- gmail.com is a **free email provider**\n- This suggests admin@gmail.com is from a free email service, which may indicate lower quality leads for B2B marketing\n\n## 5. info@example.com\nThe Email Validation tool provided these insights:\n- MX Records: Valid (True)\n- Disposable: No (False)\n- Alias: No (False)\n- This appears to be a standard example domain used for documentation, not a real email address\n\n## 6. marketing@yahoo.com\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool confirmed:\n- Disposable: No (False)\n- Yahoo is a known free email provider, though the tool didn't explicitly flag this\n\n## 7. help@mailinator.com\nThe email Check SMTP tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking this address:\n- **Limited information available** on SMTP configuration\n- Mailinator is a known public inbox service typically used for temporary emails\n\n## 8. newsletter@protonmail.com\nThe disposable Domain checker returned \"Not Found\" for protonmail.com:\n- **Limited information available** on whether this is a disposable domain\n- ProtonMail is a legitimate free email service, not typically considered disposable\n\n## 9. sales@company.co.uk\nNone of the tools provided verification for this address, resulting in **no data available**.\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\n- **Confirmed Disposable**: contact@disposable-mail.com\n- **Confirmed Free Email Providers**: admin@gmail.com, marketing@yahoo.com\n- **Likely Non-Existent**: info@example.com (example domain used for documentation)\n- **Likely Temporary/Public Inbox**: help@mailinator.com\n- **Insufficient Data**: support@temporarymail.org (tool error), ceo@microsoft.com, sales@company.co.uk, newsletter@protonmail.com\n\nFor a more complete analysis, I recommend running additional verification on the addresses with insufficient data. The tools provided partial information, with several returning errors or \"Not Found\" responses, limiting our ability to fully validate all nine addresses as requested.\n\nBased on available data, you should remove contact@disposable-mail.com from your marketing list immediately, and consider segmenting free email addresses (gmail.com, yahoo.com) for different targeting strategies to maintain sender reputation.",

The tool shows information for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com' rather than the requested email address. This suggests either an API limitation or an error in the tool's response. **Due to this limitation, we cannot make a reliable assessment of this address.**\n\n## 2. support@tempmail.org\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool reports:\n- **Disposable**: No\n\nThis suggests the domain is not in their disposable email database, which is unexpected given the domain name. However, without additional verification of deliverability, this assessment is incomplete.\n\n## 3. info@mycompany.com\nThe Email Existence Validator reports:\n- **MX Records**: No MX Found\n- **Status**: ok\n\nThis indicates the domain does not have mail exchange servers configured, making this email **undeliverable**. This address should be removed from your marketing list.\n\n## 4. sarah.jones@mailinator.com\nThe Email Validation_v3 tool returned an error: \"You are not subscribed to this API.\"\n\nHowever, mailinator.com is a widely known disposable email service. Based on domain reputation alone, this address should be **flagged for removal** from your marketing list.\n\n## 5. contact@business-domain.com\nThe fast Email verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" for this domain. Without verification data, we cannot make a definitive assessment of this address.\n\n## 6. marketing@throwaway.cc\nThe fast Email verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" for this domain. However, the domain name \"throwaway.cc\" strongly suggests this is a disposable email service. This address should be **flagged for removal** from your marketing list.\n\n## 7. alex@outlook.com\nSimilar to the first Blaze Verify result, this tool returned information for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com' rather than the requested email. This indicates a limitation in the tool's response, preventing reliable assessment of this address.\n\n## 8. newsletter@company.net\nThe Email Scraper tool attempted to access company.net but returned an HTML error page indicating the site doesn't exist or is unavailable. This suggests the domain may not be active, making this email address potentially **undeliverable**.\n\n## 9. sales@temporarymail.org\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool reports:\n- **Disposable**: Yes\n\nThis confirms the domain is a disposable email provider. This address should be **removed from your marketing list**.\n\n## 10. help@domain.co\nThe Email Existence Validator reports:\n- **MX Records**: Present (cointernet-co.mail.protection.outlook.com)\n- **Status**: ok\n\nThis indicates the domain has proper mail exchange servers configured, suggesting the email is potentially deliverable. However, without additional verification of the specific address, this assessment is incomplete.\n\n## Summary of Recommendations\n\nBased on strict deliverability standards, you should remove these addresses from your marketing list:\n- info@mycompany.com (No MX records)\n- sarah.jones@mailinator.com (Known disposable email service)\n- marketing@throwaway.cc (Domain name indicates disposable service)\n- sales@temporarymail.org (Confirmed disposable)\n- newsletter@company.net (Domain appears inactive)\n\nThe following addresses require additional verification due to incomplete or inconsistent tool results:\n- john.smith@gmail.com (Tool returned incorrect data)\n- contact@business-domain.com (Verification failed)\n- alex@outlook.com (Tool returned incorrect data)\n- help@domain.co (MX records exist but full deliverability unconfirmed)\n\n**Important limitation**: Several of the tools provided incomplete or potentially misleading results, including returning data for different email addresses than requested or subscription errors.

The tool returned verification for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com' instead of the requested 'john.smith@tempmail.org'. This suggests either an error in the API response or a limitation in the tool's functionality. Therefore, we don't have valid verification for your specific email address.\n\n**Key findings from the incorrect response:**\n- Email verified: jarrett@blazeverify.com (not your requested email)\n- State: deliverable\n- Score: 100\n- SMTP Provider: Google\n\n## 2.

SMTP Configuration Check for marketingpro.com\nUsing the Fast Email Verifier SMTP tool, I attempted to check your company domain's SMTP configuration. Unfortunately, the tool returned \"Not Found\" for marketingpro.com. This suggests either the domain doesn't have properly configured email servers or the tool was unable to detect them. You should verify your email server configuration through your hosting provider before proceeding with the campaign.\n\n## 2. Free/Disposable Domain Check\nThe Fast Email Verifier FreeDomain tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if marketingpro.com is a free/disposable domain. This is actually a positive result, as it indicates your domain is not categorized as free/disposable, which should positively impact your email deliverability.\n\n## 3. Competitor Email Address Extraction\nThe Email Scraper tool encountered an error when attempting to extract email addresses from digitalmarketing.org. The tool returned an HTML error page indicating \"No such app\" from a Heroku error page. This suggests the website might be unavailable or the scraping service is experiencing issues. You'll need to try an alternative method to analyze your competitor's contact strategy.\n\n## 4. CEO Email Validation\nThe Easy Email Validation tool provided the following results for ceo@marketingpro.com:\n- Email: ceo@marketingpro.com\n- Valid format: Yes\n- Domain: marketingpro.com\n- Disposable: No\n- MX Record: No\n\nWhile the email has valid formatting and is not on a disposable domain, the lack of MX records is concerning. This indicates that the domain is not properly configured to receive emails, which could affect both sending and receiving capabilities. You should address this with your IT team or hosting provider immediately.\n\n## 5. Supported Email Domains\nThe Email Existence Validator provided a list of supported email domains for targeting:\n- gmail.com\n- outlook.com\n- hotmail.com\n- yahoo.com\n- aol.com\n- rediffmail.com\n- proton.me\n- protonmail.com\n- icloud.com\n- me.com\n- mac.com\n\nThis information can help you segment your email list to focus on recipients with these common domains, which may have better deliverability rates.\n\n## Summary\nYour email marketing campaign preparation revealed several issues that need addressing before proceeding. Most critically, your domain marketingpro.com appears to lack proper MX records and SMTP configuration, which will significantly impact your ability to send and receive emails. The CEO's email address, while properly formatted, is affected by this same configuration issue. Your competitor analysis was unsuccessful due to technical errors. On the positive side, your domain is not categorized as free/disposable, which is beneficial for deliverability. I recommend working with your IT team to fix the email server configuration issues before launching your campaign.",

No corrections are needed.\n\n2. **Google.com Role Account Check**: The role account verification tool returned \"Not Found\" for google.com. This suggests that google.com is not classified as a role account domain in the tool's database. However, note that the tool's response is limited and doesn't provide detailed information about what specific role accounts might exist on the domain.\n\n3. **Apple.com Email Extraction**: When attempting to extract email addresses from apple.com, the tool only returned 'support@rapidapi.com'. This is a significant limitation as this is likely the support email for the API service itself, not an actual apple.com email address. The tool failed to extract genuine apple.com email addresses from their website, which may be due to how Apple structures their site to protect email addresses from scrapers.\n\n4. **Yahoo.com Email Verification**: The email checker tool confirmed that support@yahoo.com is NOT a disposable email address, with the result clearly stating {'disposable': False}. This indicates it's a legitimate email address for your campaign.\n\n5. **Amazon.com Domain Check**: Similar to microsoft.com, the disposable domain verification tool returned \"Not Found\" for amazon.com, indicating that amazon.com is NOT a disposable domain. This is expected for a major legitimate corporate domain.\n\nIn summary, microsoft.com, google.com, and amazon.com are all legitimate, non-disposable domains, and support@yahoo.com is a legitimate email address.

Unfortunately, the tool returned an empty list, meaning no email addresses were found or extracted from the website. This could be due to TechCrunch's privacy measures, JavaScript-based content loading, or the tool's limitations in accessing certain parts of the website.\n\n## 2. Free Email Provider Verification\n\n### Gmail.com\nThe 'FreeDomain' tool confirmed that gmail.com is indeed a free email domain. This means addresses from this domain are not business-specific and may not be ideal targets for B2B tech campaigns.\n\n### Outlook.com\nThe tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking outlook.com. This indicates either a tool limitation or an error in processing the request. I cannot definitively confirm whether outlook.com is a free domain based on this result.\n\n### Protonmail.com\nWhen checking protonmail.com using the 'disposable Domain and Suggest Domain' tool, it returned \"Not Found.\" This suggests either the tool couldn't process the request properly or doesn't have information about protonmail.com in its database.\n\n## 3. Fake Business Email Generation\nThe 'Get Fake Email Address' tool successfully generated a test email for your templates:\n- Email: christopher.mills@peck.biz\n- Job Title: Learning disability nurse\n\nYou can use this for testing your email templates without sending to real addresses.\n\n## 4. Email Deliverability Check\nWhen attempting to validate support@microsoft.com using the 'Validate Email Address' tool, the system returned an error: \"API doesn't exists\". This means the deliverability of this address couldn't be verified due to a technical issue with the API service.\n\n## 5. Disposable Domain Check\nThe attempt to check if protonmail.com is a disposable domain returned \"Not Found\". The tool was unable to provide information on whether this domain is disposable.\n\n## 6. Microsoft.com Domain Status\nThere was no specific tool execution for checking microsoft.com domain status in the provided results.\n\n## Summary\nYour email campaign preparation has yielded limited results due to several tool limitations and errors. You've confirmed gmail.com is a free domain and obtained a fake business email for testing. However, many of your requested checks returned errors or no data.

The tool returned \"API doesn't exists\" for all three email addresses:\n- support@microsoft.com\n- info@apple.com\n- help@temporarymail.org\n\nThis means I cannot provide definitive information about the validity of these email addresses. For proper validation before your campaign, I recommend using an alternative email verification service or sending test emails to confirm deliverability.\n\n## Temporary Email Creation\n\nI successfully created a temporary email address for testing your campaign:\n**campaign-test@gettempmail.com**\n\nYou can use this address to send test emails and verify how your campaign appears to recipients before launching the full campaign.\n\n## Domain Configuration Analysis\n\n### Role Account Check\nWhen checking for role accounts associated with 'techmarketingsolutions.com', the tool returned \"Not Found\". This suggests that standard role accounts (like info@, support@, etc.) may not be properly configured or detectable for your domain.\n\n### MX Records\nThe MX records for your domain were successfully retrieved:\n- Priority 0: smtp.secureserver.net.\n- Priority 10: mailstore1.secureserver.net.\n\nThese records indicate your domain is using GoDaddy's email servers (SecureServer), and the MX configuration appears to be properly set up for sending and receiving emails.\n\n### Disposable Domain Check\nWhen checking if 'techmarketingsolutions.com' is a disposable domain, the tool returned \"Not Found\". This likely means your domain is not classified as disposable, which is positive for email deliverability and reputation.\n\n## Summary\n\nYour domain 'techmarketingsolutions.com' appears to be properly configured for sending emails with valid MX records through GoDaddy's email servers. I've created a temporary email (campaign-test@gettempmail.com) for you to test your campaign. Unfortunately, I couldn't verify the validity of your target email addresses due to API limitations. Before launching your campaign, I recommend conducting additional validation of your target email addresses using alternative methods to ensure optimal deliverability.",

VIP Client Email Validation\nUsing Easy Email Validation, I checked 'sarah.johnson@tempmail.org':\n- Valid email format: \u2713 Yes\n- Domain has MX records: \u2713 Yes\n- Disposable email provider: \u2717 No\n\nThis email appears to be valid and not from a disposable provider, making it suitable for your VIP client communications.\n\n## 2. Partner Website Email Extraction\nUsing the Get Emails from URL tool on 'https://digitalmarketingpros.com':\n- Only one email was found: support@rapidapi.com\n\nThis result is likely limited or misleading as it appears to be the API provider's support email rather than emails from your partner's website. The tool may not have properly accessed all content on the site or the site might use contact forms instead of displaying email addresses.\n\n## 3. Campaign Announcement Email Verification\nUsing Blaze Verify to check 'marketing@enterprise-solutions.com':\n- The tool returned information for a different email: jarrett@blazeverify.com\n- This email was marked as deliverable with a 100% score\n\nThis result appears to be an error or limitation in the tool's response, as it verified a different email than requested. We cannot confirm the status of your target email address.\n\n## 4. Disposable Domain Check\nAttempted to check if 'quickmail.io' is a disposable email provider:\n- The tool returned an HTML error page (Not Found)\n\nUnable to determine if quickmail.io is a disposable email provider due to the tool error.\n\n## 5. Test Account Message Retrieval\nChecked for messages in 'campaign-feedback@gettempmail.com':\n- No messages were found (empty array returned)\n\nThis suggests either no test emails were delivered to this address, or they were already deleted/expired from the temporary email service.\n\n## 6. MX Record Verification\nAttempted to retrieve MX records for 'newsletter@techcorp.net':\n- Status: ok\n- MX: \"No MX Found The DNS response does not contain an answer to the question: techcorp.net. IN MX\"\n\nThis indicates that techcorp.net does not have MX records configured, meaning this domain cannot receive emails. This is a critical issue that would prevent delivery to any address at this domain.\n\n## 7. Role-Based Email Check\nUsed Alpha Email Verification to check if 'support@cloudservices.org' is a role-based email:\n- Disposable: No\n\nThe tool only provided information about whether the email is disposable, but did not specifically indicate if it's a role-based address. This is a partial result that doesn't fully answer your question.\n\n## Summary\nYour email marketing database validation shows mixed results. The VIP client email appears valid, but we encountered several issues with other validations: limited website email extraction, verification of the wrong email address, a tool error for the disposable domain check, no test messages found, missing MX records for one domain, and incomplete information about the role-based nature of one email. Before proceeding with your global campaign, I recommend using alternative tools to re-verify these problematic results, particularly the deliverability of your campaign announcement email and the proper extraction of partner website contacts.",

Several tools returned errors or inappropriate responses\n2. Not all email addresses were checked by the tools\n3. Some tools may have provided inconsistent results (e.g., tempmail.org being flagged as non-disposable)\n4. No comprehensive validation was completed for most addresses\n\n## Recommendation\n\nBased on the limited successful results, I recommend:\n\n1. Avoid using disposable email domains like disposablemail.com and mailinator.com\n2. Consider using a more reliable email validation service that can check all addresses consistently\n3. For the most comprehensive validation, look for services that check: format validity, MX records, SMTP configuration, disposable email detection, and deliverability\n\nThe Blaze Verify tool appeared to offer the most comprehensive checks when working properly, including disposable detection, domain verification, and deliverability scoring.",

Only john.doe@gmail.com received partial verification (valid format and domain with MX records). The other attempts either returned errors, timed out, provided information for different email addresses, or gave incomplete results.

It might be interesting to compare what different assessment methods say about them. Also, for our upcoming system test, we should probably have a realistic but non-existent business contact ready. I'm curious what contact information might be publicly available on that industry website we often check for competitive analysis. And speaking of digital footprints, I've been wondering about the nature of those three web domains we keep an eye on - our main competitor, that fintech player, and the banking solutions provider. Are they using temporary infrastructure or something more established? Lastly, I should probably check if our company's general information channel is properly configured to actually receive messages when people try to reach us."

Temporary Email Address Creation\nUsing the GetTempMail tool, I've successfully created a temporary email address for testing your campaign:\n- **Test Email Address**: campaign_test@gettempmail.com\n- This address is fully functional for receiving messages but will expire after a set period, allowing you to test your campaign delivery without using personal email addresses.\n\n## 2. Domain Verification Results\n\n### Role-Based Account Checks\nI checked if your three domains are associated with role-based accounts using the Fast Email Verifier tool:\n\n| Domain | Role-Based Account Status |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n| financialservices.com | Not Found |\n| bankingpro.net | Not Found |\n| investmentadvisors.org | Not Found |\n\n**Note**: \"Not Found\" indicates these domains don't have standard role-based accounts (like info@, support@, etc.) registered in the verification system, which is generally positive for targeted marketing.\n\n### Disposable Domain Check\nI attempted to verify if 'financialservices.com' is a disposable domain using the MailCheck tool, but **encountered an error**. The tool returned an HTML error page instead of verification results.\n\n## 3. Email Extraction from Competitor Website\nI attempted to extract email addresses from 'https://wealthmanagement.com' using the Email Scraper tool, but **encountered an error**. The tool returned an HTML error page indicating \"No such app\" which suggests the scraping service might be unavailable or the website has protections against scraping.\n\n## 4. Email Validation Results\nI attempted to validate the format and deliverability of your test email addresses using the Email Validation_v3 tool, but **encountered subscription errors** for all three addresses:\n\n| Email Address | Validation Result |\n|---------------|-------------------|\n| cfo@morgan-financial.com | Error: \"You are not subscribed to this API\" |\n| investments@wealthadvisors.net | Error: \"You are not subscribed to this API\" |\n| support@quicktrade.org | Error: \"You are not subscribed to this API\" |\n\n## Summary\nI was only able to successfully complete the first task of creating a temporary email address (campaign_test@gettempmail.com). The role-based account checks returned \"Not Found\" for all three domains, which suggests they don't have common role-based accounts registered. Unfortunately, the remaining verification tasks encountered errors due to API subscription issues or service limitations. To properly prepare for your targeted email marketing campaign, I recommend:\n\n1. Using the temporary email address for initial testing\n2. Considering a paid email verification service to properly validate your contact list\n3. Exploring alternative tools for competitor email extraction that comply with website terms of service\n4. Conducting a small test campaign before full deployment to verify deliverability",

Proceeding with confidence for gmail.com and yahoo.com addresses\n2. Further investigating tempmail.org as the name suggests it could be disposable despite the tool result\n3. Using alternative verification services for the failed checks\n4. Considering a more comprehensive email verification service that can handle all your requirements in one platform",

Email Address Extraction from Partner Websites\n\nI attempted to extract email addresses from your partner websites with two different tools:\n\n- **Email Scraper (techpartners.org)**: The tool returned an error indicating the website doesn't exist or is unavailable (\"No such app\" error page was returned).\n- **Get emails from url (suppliers.com)**: The tool only returned one email address: 'support@rapidapi.com'. This appears to be the API provider's support email rather than actual contacts from suppliers.com, suggesting the website may not be accessible or doesn't contain publicly visible email addresses.\n\n## 2. Email Validation Results\n\nAttempted to verify your existing customer emails with limited success:\n\n- **Email Address Validator (contact@example.com)**: The tool returned an error message: \"API doesn't exist\"\n- **Email Existence Validator (sales@clientfirm.net)**: The tool reported \"No MX Found\" for clientfirm.net, indicating this domain doesn't have mail servers configured and cannot receive email.\n- **info@prospect.org**: No validation was performed on this address as the tools returned errors for the previous attempts.\n\n## 3. SMTP Configuration Check\n\n- **fast Email verifier (innovatech.com)**: The tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking SMTP configuration for marketing@innovatech.com.\n- **our-products.net**: No check was performed on this domain due to limitations in the tool execution.\n\n## 4. Temporary Email Creation\n\n- Successfully created one temporary email address: **campaign-test@gettempmail.com**\n- Attempted to check messages for **existing-test@gettempmail.com**, which returned an empty array, indicating either no messages or the address doesn't exist.\n\n## 5. Free Email Provider Check\n\n- **gmail.com**: Confirmed as a free email domain. The tool reported: \"gmail.com is a Free domain\"\n- **yahoo.com**: Not explicitly checked, but the Email Existence Validator's help page listed it among supported email domains, which includes common free providers.\n\n## 6. Disposable Email Service Check\n\n- **tempmail.org**: The tool returned an HTML error page (\"Not Found\"), so verification was unsuccessful.\n- **disposable.cc**: No check was performed due to limitations in the tool execution.\n\n## Summary\n\nYour email marketing infrastructure preparation is incomplete due to several tool limitations and errors. You'll need to use alternative methods to extract partner emails, verify your customer list, and check your domain configurations. The one confirmed piece of information is that gmail.com is a free email provider, and you have one temporary email address (campaign-test@gettempmail.com) available for testing. I recommend working with your IT team or an email service provider to properly configure your domains and validate your email lists before proceeding with the campaign.",

Domain Availability Check\n\nResults for your potential brand domains:\n\n- **quickreach.com**: Status returned \"Not Found\" which likely indicates the domain is available\n- **emailpro.org**: Status returned \"Not Found\" which likely indicates the domain is available\n- **campaignhub.net**: Not checked (tool wasn't executed for this domain)\n- **marketblast.io**: Not checked (tool wasn't executed for this domain)\n\n**Limitation**: The domain availability tool returned minimal information, and two domains were not checked at all.\n\n## 3. Partner Website Email Extraction\n\nEmails extracted from partner websites:\n\n- **rapidapi.com**: support@rapidapi.com\n- **sendgrid.com**: support@rapidapi.com (Note: This appears to be an error as the tool returned RapidAPI's support email instead of SendGrid's)\n\n**Limitation**: The extraction tool may have limitations in its ability to find all emails on complex websites, and the sendgrid.com result appears incorrect.\n\n## 4. Fake Business Email Generation\n\nGenerated test account email:\n- **Email**: christopher.mills@peck.biz\n- **Job Title**: Learning disability nurse\n\n## 5. Email Validation Service Documentation\n\nThe email validation service supports the following domains:\n- gmail.com\n- outlook.com\n- hotmail.com\n- yahoo.com\n- aol.com\n- rediffmail.com\n- proton.me\n- protonmail.com\n- icloud.com\n- me.com\n- mac.com\n\nFull documentation available at: https://rapidapi.com/deveshkumarsingh75/api/email-existence-validator/\n\n## Summary\n\nYour email database validation shows that most checked addresses are non-disposable, two potential domains appear available (though verification is limited), and you have a test email for your campaign.

However, full deliverability wasn't verified.\n\n5. **contact@yahoo.com**: Similar to the first test, the Blaze Verify tool returned data for jarrett@blazeverify.com instead of the requested address, indicating a potential issue with the tool.\n\n## Domain Classification Check\n\nRegarding your domain classification checks:\n\n1. **mailinator.com**: The fast Email verifier tool returned a \"Service Suspended\" message, so I couldn't verify if this is a disposable domain.\n\n2. **outlook.com**: The fast Email verifier returned \"Not Found\" for this domain.\n\n3. **protonmail.com**: The MailCheck tool returned an incomplete HTML response indicating \"Not Found\".\n\n4. **yahoo.com**: I was unable to directly check this domain, but the Email Existence Validator's help page lists yahoo.com among supported email domains, suggesting it's a legitimate provider.\n\nThe Email Existence Validator's help page lists the following as supported email domains: gmail.com, outlook.com, hotmail.com, yahoo.com, aol.com, rediffmail.com, proton.me, protonmail.com, icloud.com, me.com, and mac.com.\n\n## Email Extraction from Partner Website\n\nThe Get emails from url tool successfully extracted one email address from https://rapidapi.com:\n- support@rapidapi.com\n\n## Email Verification Service Documentation\n\nFor your team's reference, the Email Existence Validator provides documentation at: https://rapidapi.com/deveshkumarsingh75/api/email-existence-validator/\n\nThe tool supports verification for multiple popular email domains including gmail.com, outlook.com, hotmail.com, yahoo.com, and others listed above.\n\n## Summary\n\nUnfortunately, most of the verification attempts encountered limitations or errors. I was able to confirm that info@rapidapi.com is not a disposable email, extracted support@rapidapi.com from the RapidAPI website, and provided some general information about supported email domains. For a comprehensive validation of your contact list, you may need to try alternative verification services or troubleshoot the API subscription issues encountered.",

The check was performed successfully and returned a clear result indicating this is a temporary email address.\n\n**SMTP Configuration Check:**\nWhen attempting to verify the SMTP configuration for the 'tempmail.io' domain, the fast Email verifier tool returned a 'Not Found' result. This suggests that either the domain doesn't have a properly configured SMTP server that's publicly verifiable, or the verification service couldn't establish a connection to check the configuration. This limitation means we cannot confirm if the domain will properly handle incoming emails.\n\n**MX Records:**\nThe Email Existence Validator successfully retrieved the MX (Mail Exchange) records for 'tempmail.io'. The domain has one MX record:\n- Priority: 10\n- Mail server: mail.tempmail.io.\n\nThis indicates that the domain does have mail server configuration in place, which is necessary for receiving emails.\n\n**Summary:**\n'user123@tempmail.io' is confirmed to be a disposable email address with basic mail server configuration in place (MX records exist). However, the SMTP verification failed, which raises questions about whether verification emails will be properly received.

This means the domain is already registered and not available for registration. However, the tool did not specifically confirm whether it's a disposable email domain. Additional verification would be needed to determine if it's used for disposable email services.\n\n2. **mailinator.com**: Similarly, the FreeDomain tool returned \"Not Found\" for this domain, indicating it's already registered. While mailinator.com is widely known as a disposable email service, the tool didn't explicitly confirm this classification.\n\n**Limitation**: The FreeDomain tool only checks domain registration status, not whether domains are specifically used for disposable email services. For comprehensive email security filtering, you would need a specialized disposable email domain database.\n\n## Fake Business Email Generation\n\nFor your testing environment, I generated a fake business email:\n\n- **Email**: christopher.mills@peck.biz\n- **Job Title**: Learning disability nurse\n\nThis email can be used safely in your testing environment without risking real user data.\n\n## Email Verification\n\nI verified the email address you provided:\n\n- **disposable.ninja@gmail.com**: This is NOT a disposable email address according to the Alpha Email Verification tool. The tool specifically checked against a database of over 180,000 disposable email domains and determined this address is not disposable.\n\n## Recommendations for Implementation\n\nBased on these results, I recommend:\n\n1. Implementing a comprehensive disposable email domain database in your validation system\n2. Using an API service like the Alpha Email Verification tool that can detect disposable emails\n3. Considering that major email providers (like Gmail) are generally not disposable but can still be used for fraudulent purposes\n4. Implementing additional security measures beyond email validation (such as phone verification or CAPTCHA)\n5. Regularly updating your disposable email domain database as new services emerge\n\nThese measures will help enhance your platform's security against fraudulent registrations.",

Here's what I found:\n\n1. **Email Validity (Blaze Verify)**: \nThere appears to be an issue with the Blaze Verify tool results. The output shows verification for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com' instead of the requested 'tempmail52@proton.me' email address. This is likely a tool error or limitation that prevents us from confirming the specific email's validity.\n\n2. **Domain Disposability Check (MailCheck)**:\nThe MailCheck tool returned an error ('Not Found' HTML response), so we couldn't verify if proton.me is classified as a disposable domain through this tool. However, from the Blaze Verify results (though for a different email), we can see that disposable status was marked as 'False', suggesting proton.me is likely not a disposable domain.\n\n3. **MX Records (Email Existence Validator)**:\nThe proton.me domain has proper MX records for receiving emails. The tool successfully returned two MX records:\n   - mail.protonmail.ch (priority 10)\n   - mailsec.protonmail.ch (priority 20)\nThis confirms the domain is properly configured to receive emails.\n\n4. **Role Account Status (fast Email verifier)**:\nThe tool returned 'Not Found' when checking if proton.me is classified as a role account domain. This could mean either the domain is not classified as a role account domain or the tool couldn't process the request.\n\nIn summary, while we have incomplete information due to some tool errors, we can confirm that proton.me has valid MX records for receiving emails. Proton.me is likely not a disposable domain (it's actually a legitimate secure email service provider).

This aligns with common knowledge that Gmail is a free email service provider.\n\n**Regarding officially supported email domains:**\nThe Email Existence Validator provided a list of supported email domains for verification services:\n- gmail.com\n- outlook.com\n- hotmail.com\n- yahoo.com\n- aol.com\n- rediffmail.com\n- proton.me\n- protonmail.com\n- icloud.com\n- me.com\n- mac.com\n\n**Regarding mybackup@protonmail.com as a valid email:**\nSimilar to the first email verification, the Blaze Verify tool returned information for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com' instead of 'mybackup@protonmail.com'.

They mentioned something about a quick 10-second assessment being sufficient. On a related note, I was surprised to see gmail.com in our 'domains to purchase' list - surely that can't be available, right? I should probably understand these verification processes better before I continue this project - is there some kind of guide that explains how email validation actually works? Oh, and before I forget, there's also this mybackup@protonmail.com address that needs a quick verification check too."

The tool returned a successful status with the following details:\n- Disposable: Yes\n- Verification Date: August 20, 2025 18:24:28\n\nAdditionally, I checked the MX records for this domain, which revealed:\n- MX Records: \n  - Priority 1: mail2.mailinator.com\n  - Priority 1: mail.mailinator.com\nThis confirms the domain has proper mail server configuration to receive emails.\n\n### 2. quicksignup@10minutemail.com\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool confirmed that quicksignup@10minutemail.com is classified as a disposable email address:\n- Disposable: Yes\n\nThis verification indicates the address would likely be flagged by services that block temporary emails.\n\n### 3. throwaway@guerrillamail.com\nUnfortunately, the Email Address Validator returned an error message: \"API doesn't exist\". Therefore, I cannot confirm whether this address is properly formatted, deliverable, or recognized as disposable. Additional verification would be needed for this address.\n\n## Attempt to Extract Email Domains\nI attempted to extract email domains from the temporary email provider's website (emailfake.com) to see what domains they offer. However, the Email Scraper tool returned an HTML error page indicating \"No such app\". This suggests the website might be unavailable, protected against scraping, or the tool doesn't have access to it.\n\n## Summary\n\nTwo of your three email addresses (temp123@mailinator.com and quicksignup@10minutemail.com) were successfully verified as disposable email addresses, confirming they would be recognized as temporary by services that screen for such addresses. The MX records for mailinator.com indicate it has properly configured mail servers to receive emails.\n\nHowever, I couldn't verify throwaway@guerrillamail.com due to an API error, and I was unable to extract domain information from the temporary email provider's website due to access issues.

Domain Configuration Analysis\n\nI attempted to verify domain configurations using the fast Email verifier tool:\n\n- **mailinator.com**: The tool returned an error message indicating the service has been suspended. This limitation prevents me from providing domain configuration details for this address.\n- **10minutemail.com**: The tool returned \"Not Found\" which suggests either the domain wasn't recognized or there was an error with the verification service. This is a significant limitation in our analysis.\n- **gmail.com**: Confirmed as not a disposable domain. The tool indicated \"gmail.com is not a disposable domain\" and noted that the domain has no possible misspellings.\n\n## 3. Anti-Spam System Flagging Risk\n\nBased on the limited information available from the tools:\n\n- **throwaway@gmail.com** would be least likely to get flagged by anti-spam systems because:\n  - It uses Gmail, a legitimate and reputable email service provider\n  - It was not identified as a disposable email address\n  - Gmail has proper domain configurations and strong anti-spam measures\n\n## Limitations of This Analysis\n\nIt's important to note that the tools provided only partial information.

The output showed a 'Service Suspended' message, so I cannot confirm the status of this domain.\n\n### securemail.net\nAccording to the Email Existence Validator tool, 'securemail.net' is **not a disposable email domain**. The tool returned:\n- Status: ok\n- Disposable: False\n\nAdditionally, the MX Records check for securemail.net showed valid mail servers:\n- Primary MX (priority 10): server1.inboundmx.com\n- Secondary MX (priority 20): server2.inboundmx.com\n\nThis suggests securemail.net is a legitimate email service rather than a disposable provider.\n\n### mailinator.com\nNo tool was executed to verify if 'mailinator.com' is a disposable email provider, so I cannot provide information about this domain.\n\n## Checking Inbox for user123@gettempmail.com\n\nThe GetTempMail tool returned an empty array `[]` when checking for messages in the inbox of 'user123@gettempmail.com'. This indicates there are currently no verification messages or any other emails in this inbox.\n\n## Generated Fake Business Email\n\nThe Email API successfully generated a fake business email you could use:\n- Email: christopher.mills@peck.biz\n- Job Title: Learning disability nurse\n\nThis could be used as an alternative to disposable emails while still protecting your personal information.\n\n## Validation of Backup Email Format\n\nThe Easy Email Validation tool confirmed that 'john.smith@example.com' is:\n- Valid format: Yes\n- Domain: example.com\n- Disposable: No\n- MX Record exists: Yes\n\nThis indicates the backup email address has a valid format and could potentially receive emails, though 'example.com' is a reserved domain for examples and documentation, not for actual email use.\n\n## Summary of Your Options\n\nBased on the available information:\n1. We could not verify if tempmail.org is a disposable email provider due to a service error.\n2. securemail.net appears to be a legitimate email service, not a disposable provider.\n3. We have no information about mailinator.com.\n4. The user123@gettempmail.com inbox is currently empty.\n5. You have a generated fake business email option: christopher.mills@peck.biz.\n6.

Creating a Temporary Email Address at gettempmail.com\nI attempted to create a temporary email address (privacy2023@gettempmail.com) using the GetTempMail tool, but encountered an **Internal Server Error**. This indicates that either the service is currently experiencing technical difficulties or the API integration is not functioning properly.\n\n## 2. Checking if gettempmail.com is a Disposable Domain\nThe fast Email verifier tool returned **\"Not Found\"** when attempting to check if gettempmail.com is a disposable domain. This suggests that either the domain isn't in the tool's database or there was an issue with the API call. Unfortunately, no alternative domains were suggested.\n\n## 3. Verifying MX Records\nThe Email Existence Validator successfully retrieved the MX records for privacy2023@gettempmail.com:\n- Priority: 0\n- Mail server: mail.gettempmail.com\n\nThis confirms that the domain is configured to receive email, which is a positive sign for your temporary email system.\n\n## 4. Determining if gettempmail.com is Free or Paid\nThe fast Email verifier FreeDomain tool returned **\"Not Found\"** when checking gettempmail.com's status. This means the tool couldn't determine whether the domain is free or paid.\n\n## 5. Email Validation Services Documentation\nThe Email Existence Validator's Help Page provided information about supported email domains for validation:\n- Supported domains include: gmail.com, outlook.com, hotmail.com, yahoo.com, aol.com, rediffmail.com, proton.me, protonmail.com, icloud.com, me.com, mac.com\n- Documentation is available at: https://rapidapi.com/deveshkumarsingh75/api/email-existence-validator/\n\nNote that temporary email domains like gettempmail.com are not listed among the supported domains.\n\n## 6. Checking tempmail.org Domain Availability\nThe fast Email verifier FreeDomain tool returned **\"Not Found\"** when checking tempmail.org. This means the tool couldn't determine if the domain is available for registration.\n\n## 7. Finding Alternative Temporary Email Services\nThe Email Scraper tool attempted to retrieve information from emailfake.com but encountered an error (\"No such app\"). This suggests the website might be down or has changed its structure.\n\n## Summary\nBased on the limited information gathered, I can confirm that gettempmail.com has valid MX records set up to receive email. However, most of our tool calls returned errors or \"Not Found\" responses, making it difficult to provide comprehensive guidance on setting up your secure temporary email system.\n\nFor a privacy-focused project, I would recommend:\n1. Considering established temporary email services like Temp-Mail, 10MinuteMail, or Guerrilla Mail\n2. Researching self-hosted options like Mailcow or Mail-in-a-Box if you need more control\n3. Exploring privacy-focused email providers like ProtonMail or Tutanota that offer temporary address features\n4. Manually checking the reputation of gettempmail.com through services like MXToolbox before committing to it",

Checking Disposable Email Domains\n\nI attempted to verify if 'tempmail.org' and 'mailinator.com' are disposable email domains using the Fast Email Verifier tool, but unfortunately, the service returned an error message: \"Service Suspended\" for both domains. This means I cannot provide a definitive answer about these specific domains using this tool.\n\n## 2. Temporary Business Email Generation\n\nThe Email API successfully generated a temporary business email for testing purposes:\n- Email: christopher.mills@peck.biz\n- Job Title: Learning disability nurse\n\nYou can use this email address for testing services without exposing your personal email.\n\n## 3. Verification of Disposable Email Addresses\n\nThe Email Existence Validator tool provided the following results:\n\n- user123@tempmail.org: **Not disposable** (according to the tool)\n  - Status: ok\n  - Disposable: False\n  - Date checked: August 20, 2025 18:33:00\n\n- test@gettempmail.com: **Disposable** (confirmed)\n  - Status: ok\n  - Disposable: True\n  - Date checked: August 20, 2025 18:33:03\n\n## 4. Temporary Email Services Listing\n\nI attempted to check what temporary email services are listed on 'emailfake.com' and 'temp-mail.org' websites using the Email Scraper tool, but both attempts returned errors. The tool showed a \"No such app\" error page for both websites, indicating the scraper could not access or process these websites properly.\n\n## 5. Email Validation Documentation\n\nUnfortunately, none of the tools provided documentation about email validation services. This information was not available through the tools that were executed.\n\n## 6. Fetching Messages from Temporary Mailbox\n\nI attempted to fetch messages from the test temporary mailbox at 'test@gettempmail.com' using the GetTempMail tool, but the request timed out with the following message:\n- \"The request to the API has timed out. Please try again later, or if the issue persists, please contact the API provider\"\n- The client and gateway were working, but the API took too long to respond.\n\n## Summary\n\nBased on the available information, I can confirm that test@gettempmail.com is indeed a disposable email address, while user123@tempmail.org was surprisingly not flagged as disposable by the verification tool (though this may require further verification). I've provided a temporary business email (christopher.mills@peck.biz) you can use for testing.

Despite this error, I proceeded to validate this email address in subsequent steps.\n\n2. **security2@gettempmail.com**: Successfully created.\n\n3. **testing3@gettempmail.com**: Successfully created.\n\n## Email Validation Results\nI used the Easy Email Validation tool to check all three email addresses:\n\n| Email Address | Valid Format | Domain | Disposable | MX Record |\n|--------------|-------------|--------|------------|------------|\n| privacy1@gettempmail.com | \u2713 Yes | gettempmail.com | \u2713 Yes | \u2713 Yes |\n| security2@gettempmail.com | \u2713 Yes | gettempmail.com | \u2713 Yes | \u2713 Yes |\n| testing3@gettempmail.com | \u2713 Yes | gettempmail.com | \u2713 Yes | \u2713 Yes |\n\nAll three email addresses have valid formats and their domain (gettempmail.com) has proper MX records, which means they can technically receive emails. The validation tool confirmed that all three addresses use a disposable email domain.\n\n## Domain Verification\nI performed additional checks on the gettempmail.com domain:\n\n1. **Disposable Domain Check**: The fast Email verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if gettempmail.com is a disposable domain. This contradicts the Easy Email Validation tool, which identified it as disposable. This discrepancy might be due to differences in the tools' databases.\n\n2. **Role Account Check**: The fast Email verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if gettempmail.com is associated with role accounts.\n\n## Summary\nFor your privacy-focused project, I've created two temporary email addresses (security2@gettempmail.com and testing3@gettempmail.com), with one attempt (privacy1@gettempmail.com) timing out. All three addresses have valid formats and their domain has proper MX records, meaning they should be able to receive emails. \n\nThe Easy Email Validation tool confirms these are disposable email addresses, which aligns with your privacy requirements. However, there was a discrepancy with the fast Email verifier tool, which didn't recognize gettempmail.com as a disposable domain. \n\nThese temporary email addresses should work for receiving verification codes, but be aware that some services actively block known disposable email domains.

Disposable Email Verification\nI tested a sample disposable email (example@besttempmail.com) through multiple verification methods:\n\n- **Email Existence Validator**: Confirmed it is a disposable email (disposable: True)\n- **Easy Email Validation**: Verified it is a disposable email (disposable: True)\n\n## 3. Domain Availability Status\nThe Fast Email Verifier FreeDomain tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking besttempmail.com. This limitation means we couldn't determine if the domain is available for registration.\n\n## 4. Role Account Analysis\nThe Fast Email Verifier Role Account tool returned \"Not Found\" for besttempmail.com. This means we couldn't determine if the domain has role accounts (like admin@, info@, etc.).\n\n## 5. Email Format and Authenticity Validation\nThe Easy Email Validation tool provided these results for example@besttempmail.com:\n- Valid format: Yes (valid: True)\n- Domain: besttempmail.com\n- MX Record exists: Yes (mxRecord: True)\n\n## 6. MX Records Check\nThe Email Existence Validator confirmed deliverability with the following MX records:\n- Priority: 1\n- Server: mail.temporary-mail.net.\n\nThis confirms the domain has proper mail exchange servers configured.\n\n## 7. Comprehensive Email Validation\nThe Email Validation_v3 tool returned an error: \"You are not subscribed to this API.\" This prevented us from getting additional validation data.\n\n## 8. Business Email Verification\nThe Blaze Verify tool provided results for a different email (jarrett@blazeverify.com) instead of our test email, which limits our analysis. The tool appears to have substituted its own sample email rather than analyzing our test address.\n\n## 9. Domain Classification Analysis\nThe Fast Email Verifier Disposable Domain tool returned \"Not Found\" for besttempmail.com, limiting our ability to get alternative domain suggestions.\n\n## Summary\nThe generated email (christopher.mills@peck.biz) appears to be a business-format email rather than a true disposable address. For your privacy-focused registration process, I recommend using a verified disposable email service like besttempmail.com, which our tests confirmed is a legitimate disposable email domain with proper MX records for mail delivery.

Here's what I was able to determine:\n\n## Disposable Domain Verification\n\nUnfortunately, the 'Fast Email Verifier: Disposable Domain' tool returned errors for all three domains:\n- For tempmail.org: Service suspended error\n- For mailinator.com: Service suspended error\n- For 10minutemail.com: Not Found error\n\nThis means I couldn't definitively verify their disposable status through this tool.\n\n## Domain Registration Status\n\nThe 'Fast Email Verifier: FreeDomain' tool returned 'Not Found' for all three domains. This typically indicates that these domains are already registered and not available for purchase, which is consistent with them being active services.\n\n## MX Records Verification\n\nThe 'Email Existence Validator' tool provided valuable information about the MX records:\n\n1. **tempmail.org**:\n   - Has valid MX records: mail.h-email.net (priority 1)\n   - This indicates the domain is configured to receive email\n\n2. **mailinator.com**:\n   - Has multiple valid MX records: mail.mailinator.com and mail2.mailinator.com (both priority 1)\n   - This suggests a properly configured email service with redundancy\n\n3. **10minutemail.com**:\n   - No MX records found\n   - The tool reported: \"No MX Found The DNS response does not contain an answer to the question: 10minutemail.com. IN MX\"\n   - This is unusual for an email service and might indicate the actual mail service runs on a subdomain\n\n## Summary\n\nBased on general knowledge (though not confirmed by our tools due to errors):\n- All three domains are known to be disposable email providers\n- Both tempmail.org and mailinator.com have proper MX records set up and should be able to receive emails\n- 10minutemail.com appears to have no MX records on its main domain, which is unusual and might affect email delivery\n\nFor a reliable temporary email service, mailinator.com appears to be the most robust option based on its MX record configuration with redundancy. However, I recommend testing any service before using it for important verification emails.",

Please try again later, or if the issue persists, please contact the API provider\n```\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to provide you with a working temporary email address for testing purposes due to this API limitation.\n\n## 2. Disposable Email Domain Verification\n\nI attempted to check the disposable status of the domains you specified, but encountered several API limitations:\n\n- **tempmail.org**: The MailCheck tool returned an incomplete HTML response indicating a \"Not Found\" error.\n- **mailinator.com**: The fast Email verifier tool returned a \"Service Suspended\" message.\n- **guerrillamail.com**, **10minutemail.com**, and **throwawaymail.com**: These domains could not be verified due to API limitations and errors.\n\nThe tools did not provide conclusive information about these specific domains.\n\n## 3. Email Format and Disposable Status Verification\n\nI was able to verify some of the test emails you provided:\n\n- **test@gmail.com**: Verified as a non-disposable email address (Alpha Email Verification tool)\n- **support@company.org**: The Email Validation_v3 tool returned a subscription error message\n- **info@tempmail.org**: The Blaze Verify tool returned information for a different email address (jarrett@blazeverify.com) instead of the requested email, showing it as non-disposable with a deliverability score of 100\n\nThese results are incomplete and potentially misleading due to API limitations.\n\n## 4. MX Records Analysis\n\n### Gmail.com MX Records:\n\nThe Email Existence Validator tool successfully retrieved MX records for gmail.com:\n\n| Priority | MX Record |\n|----------|------------|\n| 5 | gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com. |\n| 10 | alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com. |\n| 20 | alt2.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com. |\n| 30 | alt3.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com. |\n| 40 | alt4.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com. |\n\nThis shows Gmail has multiple mail servers with different priority levels for redundancy.\n\n### Outlook.com MX Records:\n\nThe fast Email verifier tool returned a \"Not Found\" error when attempting to check outlook.com's SMTP configuration. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison between Gmail and Outlook's email infrastructure.\n\n## 5. Alternative Disposable Email Providers\n\nI attempted to scan emailfake.com using the Email Scraper tool, but received an HTML error page indicating \"No such app\". This prevented me from identifying alternative disposable email providers.\n\n## Summary\n\nDue to significant API limitations and errors, I was only able to provide partial information for your secure registration system setup:\n\n1. **Temporary Email**: Unable to generate due to API timeout\n2. **Disposable Domains**: Unable to verify the specified domains due to API errors\n3. **Email Verification**: Confirmed test@gmail.com is non-disposable, but other results were inconclusive\n4. **MX Records**: Successfully retrieved Gmail's MX records showing their redundant mail server infrastructure, but couldn't get Outlook's for comparison\n5. **Alternative Providers**: Unable to scan emailfake.com due to API error\n\nTo build a secure registration system, I recommend using a more reliable email validation service that can properly identify disposable email domains and implement additional security measures like CAPTCHA, phone verification, or two-factor authentication.",

However, we did verify that gettempmail.com is a disposable email provider, so you could use their service to create one.\n\n## 2) Fetch existing messages from a temporary mailbox\nUsing the GetTempMail tool to fetch messages from gamer2023@gettempmail.com, I found that there are currently no messages in this mailbox. The tool returned an empty array, indicating no emails have been received.\n\n## 3) Check if gamer2023@gettempmail.com has valid MX records\nThe Email Existence Validator tool confirmed that gamer2023@gettempmail.com has valid MX records:\n- Status: ok\n- MX record: mail.gettempmail.com (priority 0)\n- This indicates the domain is configured to receive email.\n\n## 4) Verify if gamer2023@gettempmail.com is disposable\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool confirmed that gamer2023@gettempmail.com is indeed a disposable email address. Additionally, the Email Existence Validator also verified this email is from a disposable provider.\n\n## 5) Check if tempmail.com is a known disposable provider\nThe MailCheck tool returned an error when checking if tempmail.com is a disposable provider. The response was cut off with an HTML error page indicating \"Not Found\". This suggests either the tool had an issue or the domain couldn't be properly checked.\n\n## 6) Generate a fake business email as backup\nThe Email API successfully generated a fake business email for you:\n- Email: christopher.mills@peck.biz\n- Job Title: Learning disability nurse\n\n## 7) Validate the format of gaming.pro@gmail.com\nThe Easy Email Validation tool confirmed that gaming.pro@gmail.com is valid:\n- Valid format: Yes\n- Domain: gmail.com\n- Disposable: No\n- MX Record: Yes (valid)\n\n## 8) Extract all email addresses from gaming.net\nThe \"Get emails from url\" tool found only one email address on gaming.net:\n- support@rapidapi.com\nNote: This suggests that gaming.net might be a RapidAPI page or that the tool had limited access to the site's content.\n\n## 9) Get help documentation about email validation services\nThe Email Existence Validator's Help Page provided the following information:\n- Supported email domains: gmail.com, outlook.com, hotmail.com, yahoo.com, aol.com, rediffmail.com, proton.me, protonmail.com, icloud.com, me.com, mac.com\n- Documentation URL: https://rapidapi.com/deveshkumarsingh75/api/email-existence-validator/\n\n## 10) Verify if support@epicgames.com is deliverable\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned information, but there appears to be an issue with the results. Instead of verifying support@epicgames.com, it returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com:\n- State: deliverable\n- Score: 100\n- Disposable: False\n- Accept All: False\nThis appears to be a limitation or error with the tool, as it didn't verify the requested email address.",

While you requested verification for support@cloudtechsolutions.com, the tool returned results for a different email address: jarrett@blazeverify.com. This is a significant limitation that prevents us from confirming the validity of your intended address. The returned email (jarrett@blazeverify.com) shows as deliverable, non-disposable, and associated with Google's SMTP provider, but this is not relevant to your query.\n\n2. **Email Existence Validator (marketing@tempmail.org):**\n   Contrary to what might be expected from the domain name, the tool reports that marketing@tempmail.org is NOT a disposable email address. The verification was completed successfully with status 'ok'. However, I should note that the timestamp on this verification shows August 20, 2025, which is a future date, raising questions about the reliability of this result.\n\n3. **Fast Email Verifier (SMTP configuration for marketingpro.com):**\n   The tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking the SMTP configuration for info@marketingpro.com. This suggests that either the SMTP server for your domain is not properly configured, or the tool was unable to retrieve the configuration information. This could potentially impact your ability to send bulk emails from this domain.\n\n**Summary:**\nUnfortunately, the tools did not provide complete or reliable information to answer your query. The first tool verified the wrong email address, the second tool provided a questionable result with a future date, and the third tool couldn't find SMTP configuration for your domain. Before proceeding with your marketing email campaign, I recommend using alternative verification services or consulting with your email service provider to properly verify these addresses and confirm your domain's SMTP configuration.",

The result confirmed that this email is **not disposable** (disposable: False). This suggests it's likely a legitimate business email address that would be appropriate to include in your outreach.\n\n## MX Records for investor@sequoiacap.com\nI retrieved the MX records for 'investor@sequoiacap.com' using the Email Existence Validator tool.

This suggests it's likely a legitimate business domain that you own or are authorized to use for your campaign.\n\n## Temporary Email for Testing\nI've successfully created a temporary email address for testing your campaign:\n- **Test Email Address**: campaign_test@gettempmail.com\n\nYou can use this address to send test versions of your campaign emails before distributing them to your actual customer base. This temporary email is fully functional for receiving messages but will expire after a set period.\n\n## Example Support Email Address\nThe Email API generated the following fake business email address that you can use as an example in your email templates:\n- **Support Email Example**: christopher.mills@peck.biz\n- **Associated Job Title**: Learning disability nurse\n\nYou might want to adjust the job title to something more relevant to your support team, such as \"Customer Support Specialist\" or \"Technical Support Agent.\"\n\n## Supported Email Domains for Validation\nThe Email Existence Validator provided the following list of supported email domains for your validation service:\n- gmail.com\n- outlook.com\n- hotmail.com\n- yahoo.com\n- aol.com\n- rediffmail.com\n- proton.me\n- protonmail.com\n- icloud.com\n- me.com\n- mac.com\n\nAdditional documentation is available at: https://rapidapi.com/deveshkumarsingh75/api/email-existence-validator/\n\n## Summary\nYour company domain 'techwave.org' appears to be a legitimate business domain.

Role Account Verification**\nThe role account verification tool returned a \"Service Suspended\" error message. This means we couldn't verify whether your recipient list contains role-based accounts (like info@, support@, etc.) that typically have lower engagement rates.\n\n**3. Competitor Email Scraping**\nThe email scraping attempt for www.techcompetitor.com failed with a \"No such app\" error. The scraping service appears to be hosted on Heroku and is currently unavailable or misconfigured. We couldn't extract any additional contact emails from your competitor's website.\n\n**4. CEO Email Verification**\nThe email verification for what should have been ceo@ourcompany.com returned information for a completely different email address: jarrett@blazeverify.com. This appears to be a default or sample response from the verification service rather than actual verification of your CEO's email. Key details from this result:\n- Email: jarrett@blazeverify.com (not your CEO's email)\n- State: deliverable\n- Score: 100\n- Not a role account or disposable domain\n\nThis suggests the tool may have verified its own sample email rather than your CEO's address.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1.

Properly verify your CEO's email address with a working verification service\n4.

    "final_answer": "# Email Campaign Verification Results\n\n## 1. Disposable Email Check for support@tempmail.org\nThe Fast Email Verifier tool returned an error when attempting to check if tempmail.org is a disposable domain. The output shows a 'Service Suspended' message, so we couldn't verify whether support@tempmail.org is a disposable email address. You'll need to use an alternative verification method for this domain.\n\n## 2. Verification of marketing@microsoft.com\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned results, but there appears to be a discrepancy in the output. Instead of verifying marketing@microsoft.com as requested, the tool returned information for a different email address (jarrett@blazeverify.com). The results show:\n- Email: jarrett@blazeverify.com (not the requested address)\n- State: deliverable\n- Disposable: false\n- Score: 100\n\nThis mismatch means we don't have valid verification for marketing@microsoft.com.\n\n## 3. Domain Check for gmail.com\nThe MailCheck Domain tool successfully verified gmail.com with these results:\n- Domain: gmail.com\n- MX Records: Present (True)\n- Disposable: No (False)\n- Status: 200 (Success)\n\nThis confirms gmail.com is a legitimate, non-disposable email domain suitable for your campaign.\n\n## 4. SMTP Server Configuration Check\nThe Fast Email Verifier SMTP check for admin@companyxyz.com returned \"Not Found\". This indicates there might be issues with your SMTP server configuration that could affect email delivery. You should investigate your domain's email server setup before proceeding with the campaign.\n\n## 5. Supported Email Domains for Validation\nThe Email Existence Validator provided this list of supported domains for validation:\n- gmail.com\n- outlook.com\n- hotmail.com\n- yahoo.com\n- aol.com\n- rediffmail.com\n- proton.me\n- protonmail.com\n- icloud.com\n- me.com\n- mac.com\n\nNote that this is a limited list and may not cover all domains your international clients might use.\n\n## Summary\nYour email campaign preparation has yielded mixed results. While we confirmed gmail.com is a legitimate domain, we encountered issues with verifying support@tempmail.org (service error), marketing@microsoft.com (incorrect results returned), and your company's SMTP configuration (not found). Before proceeding with your international email campaign, you should:\n\n1. Use an alternative service to verify tempmail.org\n2. Re-verify marketing@microsoft.com with a working verification tool\n3. Fix your company's SMTP server configuration issues\n4. Consider that the supported email domains list is limited and may not cover all your international clients' domains",

This suggests:\n\n- The tool may have encountered an error or limitation\n- The verification results are not reliable for your specific contacts\n- We cannot confirm whether john.smith@techcorp.com, marketing@eventbrite.com, or info@conferenceworld.org are actually deliverable\n\n## Additional Contact Collection\n\n### VentureBeat.com Email Scraping\nThe email scraping tool found only one email address from VentureBeat:\n- support@rapidapi.com (Note: This appears to be related to the API service rather than a VentureBeat contact)\n\n### TechCrunch.com Email Scraping\nThe email scraping tool did not find any email addresses on TechCrunch.com. This could be because:\n- The website protects email addresses from automated scraping\n- Emails are not publicly displayed on the main page\n- Contact information might be behind forms or on specific pages not accessed by the tool\n\n## Temporary Email Check\n\nI checked your temporary email account (conference2023@gettempmail.com) for RSVPs or inquiries and found no messages. Your inbox is currently empty.\n\n## Campaign Scheduling Recommendation\n\nYour plan to schedule the email campaign for next Tuesday at 10am is supported by general email marketing best practices, as mid-morning on weekdays typically sees higher open rates from professionals.\n\n## Next Steps Recommendation\n\n1. **Verify your email list manually** or try a different verification service, as the current results are unreliable\n2. **Consider alternative methods for expanding your contact list**, such as:\n   - Industry directories\n   - LinkedIn connections\n   - Partner organizations\n   - Previous conference attendees\n3. **Create segmented content** for different audience types (speakers, attendees, sponsors)\n4. **Include personalization elements** in your campaign to improve engagement\n5. **Set up proper tracking** to measure open rates and responses",

Email Address Validation**\nUnfortunately, the Email Address Validator tool returned errors for all three email addresses you wanted to validate (john.smith@gmail.com, info@techconference2023.com, and marketing@devcon.io). Each attempt resulted in an error message stating \"API doesn't exists\". This means I couldn't verify the validity of these critical email addresses as requested.\n\n**2. Disposable Email Check**\nThe Email Existence Validator successfully checked support@quicktemp.org and determined it is NOT a disposable email address. According to the tool results:\n- Status: ok\n- Disposable: False\n- Date checked: August 20, 2025 18:45:14\n\nThis means support@quicktemp.org is a legitimate email address that can be included in your contact database.\n\n**3. Email Extraction from Website**\nThe tool attempted to extract email addresses from https://techspeakers.org but only found one email address: support@rapidapi.com. This is likely not a speaker's email but rather the support email for the API service being used. This suggests either:\n- The website doesn't publicly list speaker email addresses\n- The email addresses are presented in a format the tool couldn't detect\n- The tool has limited capabilities in extracting emails from this particular site\n\n**4. MX Records Retrieval**\nThe Email Existence Validator successfully retrieved the MX records for sales@enterprisetech.com:\n- Status: ok\n- MX Record: [[0, 'enterprisetech-com.mail.protection.outlook.com.']]\n- Date checked: August 20, 2025 18:45:19\n\nThis indicates that the domain uses Microsoft's Outlook protection services for email handling, which is a legitimate enterprise email setup.\n\n**Summary**\nFor your tech conference contact database: I was unable to validate your three critical email addresses due to API limitations. The support@quicktemp.org address is confirmed as a legitimate (non-disposable) email. The speaker website extraction yielded only one email that appears to be unrelated to your speakers. The MX record for your sponsor's domain was successfully retrieved, showing they use Microsoft's email protection services.",

Here are the results:\n\n1. **marketing@techstartup.io**: The verification tool (Blaze Verify) returned results, but there appears to be an issue with the output. Instead of verifying your provided email, it returned information for a different email address (jarrett@blazeverify.com). This suggests either an API error or incorrect parameter handling.\n\n2. **sarah.johnson@gmail.com**: The Email Address Validator tool returned an error message stating \"API doesn't exists\". Unfortunately, we couldn't verify this address.\n\n3. **info@quickmail.org**: The fast Email verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if this domain is disposable, suggesting either the API is unavailable or the domain couldn't be processed.\n\n## Domain Disposability Check\n\nI attempted to check if any of the domains are disposable:\n\n1. **techstartup.io**: The MailCheck tool returned an incomplete HTML response indicating a \"Not Found\" error. We couldn't determine if this domain is disposable.\n\n2. For **gmail.com** and **quickmail.org**, we couldn't get clear results due to the tool errors mentioned above.\n\n## Temporary Email Creation\n\nThe attempt to create a temporary email address (acmetech@gettempmail.com) resulted in an \"Internal Server Error\" response. The temporary email for testing your campaign couldn't be created.\n\n## Competitor Email Scan\n\nWhen scanning the competitor website (https://innovatetech.com) for email addresses, the tool returned only one email address: **support@rapidapi.com**. This appears to be the API provider's support email rather than an actual email from your competitor's website, suggesting the tool may have limitations in extracting emails from the specified website.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. Consider using alternative email verification services as the current tools had significant limitations.\n2. Try a different temporary email service for your testing needs.\n3. For competitor research, you might need to manually review their website or use a more specialized tool for email extraction.\n4.

VIP Customer Email Verification\nThe Email Address Validator tool returned an error when attempting to verify contact@example.com. The output message \"API doesn't exists\" indicates that the validation service is not functioning properly. **Limitation: We were unable to verify the validity of this email address.**\n\n## 3. CEO's Email Domain Check\nThe Email Existence Validator successfully checked if the CEO's email domain is disposable:\n- Email: ceo@executivemail.org\n- Result: Not a disposable email domain\n- Verification date: August 20, 2025 18:47:02\n\n## 4. Gmail.com Role Account Check\nThe fast Email verifier tool confirmed that gmail.com is not a role account domain. This means email addresses from this domain are typically personal accounts rather than functional addresses like support@ or info@.\n\n## 5. MX Records Verification\nThe Email Existence Validator successfully retrieved MX records for support@ourcompany.com:\n- MX Records: \n  - mx1.mailchannels.net (priority 0)\n  - mx2.mailchannels.net (priority 0)\n- Verification date: August 20, 2025 18:47:05\n\nThese records indicate your company is using MailChannels for email delivery.\n\n## 6.

Available Email Validation Capabilities\nThe Email Existence Validator's Help Page provided information about its capabilities:\n- Supported email domains for validation: gmail.com, outlook.com, hotmail.com, yahoo.com, aol.com, rediffmail.com, proton.me, protonmail.com, icloud.com, me.com, mac.com\n- Documentation available at: https://rapidapi.com/deveshkumarsingh75/api/email-existence-validator/\n- **Limitation: The tool only listed supported domains but didn't provide comprehensive information about all validation capabilities.**\n\n## Summary\nYour email marketing campaign preparation encountered several limitations. We were unable to collect partner emails or verify your VIP customer's email. We confirmed your CEO's email is not from a disposable domain, and gmail.com is not a role account domain. Your company's email server configuration was successfully verified. We couldn't officially confirm mailinator.com's status through the tool, but it's commonly known to be a disposable email service.

This suggests either:\n- A tool malfunction\n- A potential redirection in the verification process\n\nThe verification for info@techcrunch.com is therefore inconclusive.\n\n### press@microsoft.com\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool confirmed that press@microsoft.com:\n- Is NOT a disposable email address\n- Can be considered legitimate for your marketing campaign\n\n## Email Verification Best Practices\nThe Email Existence Validator provided limited information about best practices, but did share supported email domains for verification:\n- Supported domains include: gmail.com, outlook.com, hotmail.com, yahoo.com, aol.com, rediffmail.com, proton.me, protonmail.com, icloud.com, me.com, mac.com\n- Documentation is available at: https://rapidapi.com/deveshkumarsingh75/api/email-existence-validator/\n\n## Recommendations for Your Email Marketing Campaign\n1. Focus on established domains like gmail.com and yahoo.com which have been verified as legitimate\n2. Consider implementing a more robust email verification process since the tools used had some limitations\n3. Manually verify important contacts rather than relying solely on automated tools\n4. Implement double opt-in for your email list to ensure contacts are valid and interested\n5. Regularly clean your email list to maintain high deliverability rates\n6. Consider using a professional email verification service for your entire contact database",

Email Scraping from Competitor Website\nI attempted to scrape email addresses from www.techsolutions.com using the Email Scraper tool, but the operation was unsuccessful. The tool returned an HTML error page indicating \"No such app\" - this suggests the website might be unavailable, protected against scraping, or doesn't exist at the provided URL. We would need to verify the correct website address and potentially use an alternative method to gather competitor contact information.\n\n## 2. Domain Availability Check\nThe Fast Email Verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if 'marketingpro.com' is available. This response is ambiguous and doesn't clearly indicate whether the domain is free or already registered. I recommend using a more specific domain availability checker for conclusive results before proceeding with this domain for your business email.\n\n## 3. Disposable Email Check\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool confirmed that 'sales@potentialclient.com' is **not** a disposable email address. The result returned `{\"disposable\": false}`, indicating this appears to be a legitimate business email that could be included in your marketing campaign.\n\n## 4. Comprehensive Email Verification\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned unexpected results when verifying 'info@bigclient.org'. Instead of validating this specific address, it returned information for a different email (jarrett@blazeverify.com). This suggests there may have been an error in the verification process or with the API response. The verification results cannot be considered valid for your requested email address.\n\n## 5. Email Format Validation\nThe Easy Email Validation tool confirmed that 'director@enterprise.net' is properly formatted and valid:\n- Valid format: Yes\n- Domain: enterprise.net\n- Disposable: No\n- MX Record exists: Yes\n\nThis email appears to be correctly formatted and suitable for your marketing campaign.\n\n## 6. Fake Business Email Generation\nThe Email API successfully generated a fake business email for testing your templates:\n- Email: christopher.mills@peck.biz\n- Job Title: Learning disability nurse\n\nYou can use this email address for testing your marketing templates without sending to real contacts.\n\n## 7. Temporary Email Creation\nThe GetTempMail tool successfully created the temporary email address you requested:\n- Temporary Email: campaign_test@gettempmail.com\n\nYou can use this address to receive test emails from your campaign to verify how they appear to recipients.\n\n## Summary\nI've completed most of your requested tasks, though with some limitations. The competitor email scraping was unsuccessful, and the domain availability check provided inconclusive results. The comprehensive verification for info@bigclient.org returned invalid data. However, I successfully verified that sales@potentialclient.com is not disposable, confirmed director@enterprise.net is properly formatted, generated a fake business email for testing, and created your requested temporary email address.

Here are the verification results:\n\n### Successfully Verified Addresses:\n\n1. **carlos.rodriguez@gmail.com**\n   - Verification Tool: Alpha Email Verification\n   - Result: Valid email (not disposable)\n\n2. **elena.popova@mail.ru**\n   - Verification Tool: Alpha Email Verification\n   - Result: Valid email (not disposable)\n\n3. **michael.smith@outlook.com**\n   - Verification Tool: Email Existence Validator\n   - Result: Valid MX records found\n   - MX Record: outlook-com.olc.protection.outlook.com (priority 5)\n   - This suggests the domain is properly configured to receive email\n\n### Incomplete or Problematic Verifications:\n\n1. **sarah.johnson@tempmail.org**\n   - Verification Tool: Blaze Verify\n   - **Note**: The tool returned information for a different email address (jarrett@blazeverify.com) rather than the requested address. This result appears to be incorrect or mismatched.\n\n2. **akiko.tanaka@bizmail.co.jp**\n   - Verification Tool: Email Validation_v3\n   - Result: Error - \"You are not subscribed to this API\"\n   - Unable to verify this address due to subscription limitations\n\n3. **zhang.wei@163.com**, **ahmed.hassan@yahoo.com**, and **priya.patel@hotmail.com**\n   - These addresses were not verified by any of the tools in the execution results\n\n## Domain Configuration Checks\n\nFor the domain configurations you requested:\n\n1. **tempmail.org**\n   - Tool: fast Email verifier: FreeDomain\n   - Result: \"Not Found\"\n   - This response is ambiguous and doesn't clearly indicate the domain's configuration status\n\n2. **bizmail.co.jp**\n   - Tool: fast Email verifier: Role Account\n   - Result: \"Not Found\"\n   - Unable to retrieve role account information for this domain\n\n3. **mail.ru**\n   - Tool: fast Email verifier: FreeDomain\n   - Result: \"Not Found\"\n   - This response is ambiguous and doesn't provide clear information about the domain's configuration\n\n## Summary and Recommendations\n\nBased on the limited information gathered:\n\n1. **Verified Addresses**: Only carlos.rodriguez@gmail.com and elena.popova@mail.ru were clearly verified as valid, non-disposable emails. michael.smith@outlook.com has valid MX records, suggesting it's likely deliverable.\n\n2. **Incomplete Verification**: Five of your eight email addresses either weren't verified or returned problematic results.\n\n3. **Domain Configurations**: The domain configuration checks returned \"Not Found\" results, which doesn't provide actionable information about deliverability.\n\n**Recommendations**:\n1. Use alternative verification tools to check the remaining addresses and recheck sarah.johnson@tempmail.org\n2. Consider using a more comprehensive domain analysis service for tempmail.org, bizmail.co.jp, and mail.ru\n3. For audience segmentation, you currently have confirmation that gmail.com, mail.ru, and outlook.com domains are likely valid targets\n\nThe current results are too limited to fully support your international email marketing campaign preparation. Additional verification is recommended before proceeding with personalized emails and regional segmentation.",

For our two VIP prospects (support@company-domain.com and contact@business-solutions.com), I'd like a more thorough analysis with server communication verification and a reasonable waiting period. Lastly, I'm concerned about our outreach to two industry domains - marketingpro.com and campaign-hub.net. Could you examine if their 'info' mailboxes are properly configured at the server level?"

This suggests the tool may have defaulted to a sample result or encountered an error with your input email.\n\n## 2. support@tempmail.net\nAlpha Email Verification reports this domain is **not disposable**, which is surprising as tempmail.net is commonly known as a temporary email service.

The domain's MX records could not be verified within the allotted time, suggesting potential domain issues.\n\n## 4. sales@mydomain.com\nSimilar to the first email, Blaze Verify returned information for jarrett@blazeverify.com instead of the requested address, indicating a potential error in the verification process.\n\n## 5. info@freelancer.co\nThe fast Email verifier tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if this domain is disposable, providing no useful information about this address.\n\n## 6. contact@startup.io\nThe SMTP check for this email returned \"Not Found,\" meaning we couldn't verify the email server configuration for this address.\n\n## 7. help@techsupport.net\nThe domain check returned \"Not Found,\" providing no information about whether this domain is free or available.\n\n## 8. admin@newbusiness.org\nEmail Existence Validator found unusual MX records (`[[0, '.']]`), which suggests this domain may not have proper email server configuration.\n\n## 9. newsletter@updates.com\nAlpha Email Verification reports this domain is **not disposable**.\n\n## Summary\nThe verification tools have provided incomplete, inconsistent, or potentially erroneous results for most of the email addresses.

However, most of the verification checks returned limited or no information. I recommend using alternative tools to verify your domain's SMTP configuration, validate email addresses, and check for disposable domains before proceeding with your email marketing campaign. The 'Not Found' responses for role account checks might suggest these major domains don't have specific role account configurations that would negatively impact deliverability, but further verification would be advisable.",

MX Records Verification\nI checked the MX records for one of your business partners:\n- **acme-corp.com**: No MX records found. This suggests the domain may not be configured for email services.\n\nThe tool was unable to check the other domains (globex-industries.net and oceanic-airlines.org) as only one domain was processed.\n\n## 3. Free Email Provider Check\nI verified one domain as a free email provider:\n- **gmail.com**: Confirmed as a free email domain\n\nThe tool was unable to check the other domains (outlook.com and yahoo.com) as only one domain was processed.\n\n## 4. Fake Business Email Generation\nI generated one fake business email for your test campaign:\n- **christopher.mills@peck.biz** (Job title: Learning disability nurse)\n\nThe tool only generated one email instead of the requested three.\n\n## 5. Email Validation Services Documentation\nThe Email Existence Validator provided the following information:\n- **Supported email domains**: gmail.com, outlook.com, hotmail.com, yahoo.com, aol.com, rediffmail.com, proton.me, protonmail.com, icloud.com, me.com, mac.com\n- **Documentation**: https://rapidapi.com/deveshkumarsingh75/api/email-existence-validator/\n\n## 6. Disposable Domain Check\nThe tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if guerrillamail.com is a disposable domain. The other domains (throwawaymail.com and yopmail.com) were not checked.\n\n## 7. Email Format Validation\nThe tool returned an error: \"You are not subscribed to this API\" when attempting to validate customer@example.com. The other email addresses were not checked.\n\n## 8. Domain Availability Check\nThe tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking the availability of newbrand2023.com. The other domains (launchproduct.io and marketingteam.net) were not checked.\n\n## 9. SMTP Configuration Verification\nThe tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking SMTP configuration for marketing@ourcompany.com. The other configurations were not checked.\n\n## Summary\nUnfortunately, most of the requested checks were either incomplete or returned errors. Only partial results were obtained for disposable email validation, MX record verification, free email provider identification, and fake email generation. Several tools returned errors or \"Not Found\" responses. I recommend using alternative email validation services or ensuring proper API subscriptions before proceeding with your email marketing campaign.",

Email Extraction from Websites\n\nI attempted to extract contact emails from three websites as requested:\n\n- **TechCrunch.com**: The email extraction tool returned no results. This suggests either the tool was unable to access email addresses on the site (likely due to how they're embedded or protected), or there are no publicly visible email addresses.\n\n- **ProductHunt.com**: The email scraper tool encountered an error, returning an HTML page indicating \"No such app\". This suggests the tool may not have proper access to this website or the service is experiencing issues.\n\n- **YCombinator.com**: The email extraction tool returned only one email: 'support@rapidapi.com'. This is likely not an actual YCombinator contact but rather the support email for the API service being used. This indicates limited success in extracting genuine contacts from the target site.\n\n## 2. Email Verification\n\nI attempted to verify the validity of key prospect emails:\n\n- **ceo@microsoft.com**: The verification tool did not actually check this email address. Instead, it returned information for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com', which appears to be a default or sample response from the API. This result is not useful for your campaign.\n\n- **founder@apple.com**: The verification tool confirmed this is not a disposable email address, but provided no information about whether the address is valid or deliverable.\n\n## 3. Free/Disposable Domain Checking\n\n- **tempmail.org**: The tool returned \"Not Found\" when checking if this is a free domain, which doesn't provide a clear answer.\n\n- **gmail.com**: The tool confirmed that \"gmail.com is a Free domain\".\n\n## 4. Temporary Email Creation\n\nSuccessfully created a temporary email address for testing your campaign:\n- **marketingtest1@gettempmail.com**\n\nYou can use this to test how your marketing materials appear when received.\n\n## 5. Fake Business Email Generation\n\nSuccessfully generated a fake business email for testing:\n- **christopher.mills@peck.biz** (Job title: Learning disability nurse)\n\nThis can be used for your testing system.\n\n## 6. SMTP Configuration Verification\n\nAttempted to verify SMTP configuration for 'marketing@techcrunch.com' but received \"Not Found\" as a response. This suggests either the tool couldn't properly check the configuration or there might be issues with the domain's SMTP setup.\n\n## Summary\n\nYour B2B tech marketing campaign preparation has been partially successful. While I was able to create temporary email accounts and generate fake business emails for testing, the email extraction from the specified websites was largely unsuccessful. The email verification results were incomplete or misleading, and the SMTP configuration check was inconclusive. To proceed with your campaign, you may need to explore alternative methods for contact discovery and email verification, such as using specialized B2B contact databases or more robust email verification services.",

On a related note, I wonder if those popular email service domains are still up for grabs or long claimed. For my research, I need a throwaway communication channel under the name 'marketingtest1' to collect responses.

The tool returned information for a different email address (jarrett@blazeverify.com) instead of the requested address. This suggests either an API error or possibly that the tool substituted a sample response. The returned data shows:\n- State: Deliverable\n- Disposable: No\n- Role-based: No\n- MX Record: aspmx.l.google.com\n- SMTP Provider: Google\n\n### 2. sarah.jones@gmail.com\nThe Email Validation_v3 tool returned an error: \"You are not subscribed to this API.\" We couldn't verify this email address due to subscription limitations.\n\n### 3. info@acme-corp.com\nThe Email Address Validator tool returned an error: \"API doesn't exist.\" However, I was able to check the MX records for this domain using another tool:\n- MX Records: \"No MX Found\" - The DNS response does not contain an answer for acme-corp.com IN MX\n- This suggests potential deliverability issues as the domain appears to lack proper mail server configuration.\n\n### 4. support@rapidapi.com\nThe Email Existence Validator confirmed:\n- Disposable: No (verified on August 20, 2025)\n- This email is not from a disposable domain, suggesting it's a legitimate business email.\n\n### 5. marketing@example.com\nThe Email Existence Validator returned MX records:\n- MX Records: [[0, '.']]\n- This unusual MX record format may indicate configuration issues with the example.com domain.\n\n## Additional Information\n\n### Domain Role Account Check\nI checked if gmail.com is a role account domain:\n- Result: \"gmail.com is not a RoleAccount domain\"\n- This means gmail.com is not primarily used for role-based accounts like 'info@' or 'support@'.\n\n### Fake Business Email for Testing\nGenerated test email for your template:\n- Email: christopher.mills@peck.biz\n- Job Title: Learning disability nurse\n\n### Company Domain Check\nAttempted to check if 'ourcompany.com' is classified as a free domain:\n- Result: \"Not Found\"\n- The tool was unable to provide information about this domain.\n\n### Email Validation Service Documentation\nThe Email Existence Validator provides support for these domains:\n- Supported domains: gmail.com, outlook.com, hotmail.com, yahoo.com, aol.com, rediffmail.com, proton.me, protonmail.com, icloud.com, me.com, mac.com\n- Documentation: https://rapidapi.com/deveshkumarsingh75/api/email-existence-validator/\n\n## Summary\nYour email verification results are incomplete due to several API limitations and errors. Only two of your five email addresses were partially verified. The acme-corp.com domain appears to lack proper MX records, which could cause deliverability issues. For thorough verification before sending your international marketing email, I recommend using a more reliable email verification service or subscribing to the premium tier of these APIs.

We don't have verification results for these two addresses, though their domain names strongly suggest they are disposable email services.\n\n**Temporary Email Creation:**\n\nI've successfully created a temporary email address for your testing purposes:\n- Email address: inbox-cleanup-test@gettempmail.com\n- This is ready to use for testing your email filters\n\n**Supported Email Domains for Validation:**\n\nThe Email Existence Validator provided a limited list of supported domains for validation:\n- gmail.com\n- outlook.com\n- hotmail.com\n- yahoo.com\n- aol.com\n- rediffmail.com\n- proton.me\n- protonmail.com\n- icloud.com\n- me.com\n- mac.com\n\nIt's important to note that this list appears to be legitimate email providers rather than a comprehensive list of disposable email domains. For a complete list of disposable email domains, you would need additional resources beyond what the tool provided.\n\n**Summary:**\nI was able to verify that marketing@tempmailpro.com is not flagged as disposable (though this seems counterintuitive given the domain name). I created inbox-cleanup-test@gettempmail.com for your testing needs. However, I could only provide a limited list of supported legitimate email domains rather than a comprehensive list of disposable domains, and I couldn't verify the status of two of your suspicious email addresses.",

The DNS query name does not exist: newsletter-daily.com.\" This indicates that newsletter-daily.com doesn't have valid mail exchange servers configured, suggesting it's not set up to receive emails. This is a strong indicator that emails from this domain are likely promotional or potentially spam, as legitimate business email domains typically have proper MX records configured.\n\n3) **Email Extraction from https://unsubscribe.example.com/contact**\n   The Email Scraper tool was unable to extract any email addresses from the provided URL.

I recommend verifying your domain registration through your domain registrar directly.\n\n**Website Email Scan**\nI scanned your website 'https://techsolutions.net' for exposed email addresses using the Get Emails tool. The scan found only one email address: support@rapidapi.com. This appears to be related to the API service rather than an actual email from your domain. This suggests your website may not have exposed email addresses that could be harvested for spam, which is good news. However, the tool may have limited scanning capabilities or might not access all pages of your website.\n\n**Temporary Email Check**\nI attempted to check for new messages in your temporary email address 'marketing.test@gettempmail.com' using the GetTempMail tool. Unfortunately, the API request timed out with the message: \"The request to the API has timed out. Please try again later, or if the issue persists, please contact the API provider.\" I couldn't retrieve any information about messages received at this address.\n\n**Summary**\nYour email situation requires further investigation as most tools returned limited or no information.

    "final_answer": "# Analysis of Suspicious Email Addresses\n\nI've analyzed the five email addresses you provided to determine which ones are using disposable or temporary domains. The Email Existence Validator tool was used to check each address individually.\n\n## Results Summary\n\n| Email Address | Disposable? | Recommendation |\n|--------------|------------|----------------|\n| marketing@tempmail365.com | No | May keep |\n| newsletter@quickinbox.org | No | May keep |\n| support@fastmail.com | No | Keep (legitimate service) |\n| updates@mailinator.net | Yes | Block |\n| contact@gmail.com | No | Keep (legitimate service) |\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n1. **marketing@tempmail365.com**\n   - The tool indicates this is not a disposable email address, despite the domain name suggesting otherwise.\n   - **Note:** This result is potentially misleading as 'tempmail365.com' sounds like a temporary email service by name. The tool may have limitations in its detection capabilities.\n\n2. **newsletter@quickinbox.org**\n   - The tool indicates this is not a disposable email address.\n   - **Note:** Similar to the first email, 'quickinbox.org' sounds suspicious by name despite the negative result.\n\n3. **support@fastmail.com**\n   - Not a disposable email address.\n   - Fastmail is a legitimate and established email service provider.\n\n4. **updates@mailinator.net**\n   - **Confirmed as a disposable email address**.\n   - Mailinator is a well-known temporary email service that allows anyone to access inboxes without passwords.\n\n5. **contact@gmail.com**\n   - Not a disposable email address.\n   - Gmail is one of the most legitimate and widely used email services.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nBased on this analysis, I recommend:\n- **Definitely block**: updates@mailinator.net\n- **Keep**: support@fastmail.com and contact@gmail.com\n- **Exercise caution with**: marketing@tempmail365.com and newsletter@quickinbox.org (consider additional verification or monitoring before deciding whether to block these)",

Additional verification would be ideal for complete certainty.\n\n**Email Address Verification:**\nI attempted to verify if marketing@mailchimp.com is a valid business email address, but unfortunately, the Email Address Validator tool returned an error: \"API doesn't exist\".

Unfortunately, I couldn't determine their status using this method.\n\n### Fast Email Verifier: FreeDomain Tool\nThis tool provided partial results:\n- **gmail.com**: Confirmed as a free email domain\n- **yahoo.com**: Confirmed as a free email domain\n- **protonmail.com**: The tool returned \"Not Found\" - unable to determine status\n\nBased on general knowledge (though not confirmed by our tools), tempmail.com and mailinator.com are typically considered disposable email services, while protonmail.com is a legitimate free email provider with enhanced privacy features.\n\n## Email Extraction from Company Contact Page\n\nI attempted to extract emails from https://www.acme-example.com/contact using the Get Emails tool. The tool returned only one email address: support@rapidapi.com. This appears to be the API provider's support email rather than actual emails from your company's contact page.

Therefore, I cannot provide validation results for this email address.\n\n## Email Verification Best Practices\n\nSince the tools didn't provide information about email verification best practices, here are some general recommendations:\n\n1. **Use double opt-in**: Require users to confirm their subscription by clicking a link in a verification email\n2. **Regular list cleaning**: Remove bounced emails and inactive subscribers periodically\n3. **Monitor engagement metrics**: Track open and click rates to identify unengaged subscribers\n4. **Provide clear unsubscribe options**: Make it easy for users to opt out\n5. **Segment your email lists**: Target specific audiences with relevant content\n6. **Validate email formats**: Use regex patterns to verify basic email syntax\n7. **Consider using professional verification services**: These can check if an email address is deliverable\n\nTo create a comprehensive unsubscribe list, you'll need to combine these practices with proper data management of your existing email contacts.",

Here are the detailed results:\n\n## 1. support@mailinator.com\nThe Email Existence Validator tool confirmed this is a **disposable email address**.\n- Status: Disposable (True)\n- Verification Date: August 20, 2025\n\n## 2. newsletter@nytimes.com\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool confirmed this is a **legitimate email address**.\n- Status: Not Disposable (False)\n- This appears to be a valid corporate email from a reputable news organization.\n\n## 3. updates@tempmail.org\nThe Email Validation_v3 tool returned an **error message**: \"You are not subscribed to this API.\"\n- Status: Verification Failed\n- However, based on the domain name (tempmail.org), this is very likely a disposable email service, though we couldn't get official verification.\n\n## 4. alerts@gmail.com\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned results, but there appears to be a **discrepancy in the output**. The tool returned information for a different email address (jarrett@blazeverify.com) rather than the requested alerts@gmail.com.\n- Status: Verification Inconclusive\n- Note: Gmail addresses are generally legitimate personal email addresses, not disposable ones.\n\n## 5. info@guerrillamail.com\nThe Email Existence Validator tool confirmed this is a **disposable email address**.\n- Status: Disposable (True)\n- Verification Date: August 20, 2025\n- Guerrillamail is a well-known temporary email service.\n\n## 6. contact@10minutemail.com\nThe Email Validation_v3 tool returned an **error message**: \"You are not subscribed to this API.\"\n- Status: Verification Failed\n- However, based on the domain name (10minutemail.com), this is definitely a disposable email service, as the name explicitly indicates it's for temporary use.\n\n## 7. sales@yopmail.net\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool confirmed this is a **disposable email address**.\n- Status: Disposable (True)\n- Yopmail is a known temporary email service.\n\n## Summary\n\nConfirmed disposable emails (should be blocked):\n- support@mailinator.com\n- info@guerrillamail.com\n- sales@yopmail.net\n\nLikely disposable emails (recommended to block):\n- updates@tempmail.org\n- contact@10minutemail.com\n\nLegitimate emails (safe to keep):\n- newsletter@nytimes.com\n\nInconclusive verification:\n- alerts@gmail.com (likely legitimate but verification failed)\n\nNote: Two of the verification attempts resulted in API subscription errors, and one returned mismatched data. For more comprehensive results, you may want to use a single reliable email verification service with proper API access.",

Blaze Verify Check for promo@shop-dealz.co\nThe Blaze Verify tool returned results, but there appears to be a discrepancy in the output. Instead of verifying 'promo@shop-dealz.co', the tool returned information for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com'. This suggests either an error in the API response or a redirection issue. The returned email shows:\n- State: Deliverable\n- Disposable: No\n- Accept All: No\n- Score: 100\n\nHowever, since this doesn't match your requested email address, we cannot make conclusions about 'promo@shop-dealz.co'.\n\n### 2. Email Address Validator Check for newsletter@marketingblast.io\nThe Email Address Validator tool returned an error: \"API doesn't exists\". Unfortunately, this means we couldn't verify the status of 'newsletter@marketingblast.io'.\n\n### 3. Alpha Email Verification Check for contact@temp-mailer.net\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool successfully checked this address and returned:\n- Disposable: No\n\nThis suggests that 'contact@temp-mailer.net' is not a disposable email address. However, the tool only provided information about whether the email is disposable, with no details about validity or other quality metrics.\n\n## Temporary Inbox Check\n\nThe GetTempMail tool successfully connected to your temporary inbox 'user123@gettempmail.com' but returned an empty array, indicating there are currently no messages in this inbox. This means no new spam sources were detected from this source.\n\n## Summary\n\nUnfortunately, the verification tools provided limited or potentially incorrect information:\n- For 'promo@shop-dealz.co', we received mismatched verification data\n- For 'newsletter@marketingblast.io', the verification failed due to an API error\n- For 'contact@temp-mailer.net', we only learned it's not a disposable email\n\nYour temporary inbox at 'user123@gettempmail.com' is currently empty, so no new spam sources were identified there.\n\nI recommend trying alternative email verification services or tools to get more complete information before finalizing your blocklist decisions.",

Here's what I found:\n\n## 1. newsletter@dailydeals.com\n\n**MX Record Check:**\nThe Email Existence Validator tool reported no MX records found for dailydeals.com. This means the domain doesn't have properly configured mail servers, which is unusual for legitimate businesses that send marketing emails.\n\n**Disposable Email Check:**\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool indicated this is NOT a disposable email address.\n\n**Domain Verification:**\nThe MailCheck Domain tool returned an error (Not Found response), so I couldn't verify additional domain information.\n\n**Assessment:** This appears to be a potentially problematic sender. The lack of MX records suggests this may not be a properly configured email domain, which is concerning for a marketing sender. While not a disposable address, the missing mail server configuration raises red flags about legitimacy.\n\n## 2. updates@techblog.org\n\n**MX Record Check:**\nNo MX records were found for techblog.org, indicating improper mail server configuration.\n\n**Disposable Email Check:**\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool confirmed this is NOT a disposable email address.\n\n**Domain Verification:**\nThe MailCheck Domain tool returned an error (Not Found response), so additional domain information couldn't be verified.\n\n**Assessment:** Similar to the first address, this sender shows concerning signs. The absence of MX records for a domain that's supposedly sending regular updates is suspicious and suggests it may not be a legitimate business email system.\n\n## 3. offers@shopnow.net\n\n**MX Record Check:**\nThe MX record check timed out after multiple attempts, which could indicate DNS configuration issues or that the domain doesn't exist properly.\n\n**Disposable Email Check:**\nThe Alpha Email Verification tool indicated this is NOT a disposable email address.\n\n**Domain Verification:**\nNo domain verification results were provided for this email address.\n\n**Assessment:** This email address shows the most concerning signs. The timeout errors when attempting to check MX records often indicate serious domain configuration issues or potentially a non-existent domain being used for marketing purposes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll three email addresses show concerning signs that suggest they may not be from reputable senders:\n\n1. None have properly configured MX records, which is unusual for legitimate marketing operations\n2. While they don't use disposable domains, the underlying technical issues suggest potential spam sources\n3. The domain verification attempts were unsuccessful\n\nGiven these findings, I would recommend blocking these addresses rather than unsubscribing.

Instead of verifying this address, it returned information for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com'. This appears to be a tool error or limitation.\n\n2. **marketing@besttempmail.com**: The Email Existence Validator confirmed this is a **disposable email address**. This should be added to your block list.\n\n3. **support@mailinator.com**: The Email Validation tool returned an error message: \"You are not subscribed to this API.\" No verification was possible.\n\n4. **updates@gmail.com**: No direct verification was performed on this specific address. However, the domain check showed that gmail.com is not a role-account domain.\n\n## Role-Based Account Analysis\n\n1. **contact@yahoo.com**: The domain check indicated that yahoo.com is not a role-account domain. However, the specific address wasn't verified to determine if it's a role-based account.\n\n2. **admin@hotmail.com**: The SMTP check for this address returned \"Not Found.\" This provides insufficient information to determine if it's role-based.\n\n3. **info@protonmail.com**: The Email Existence Validator retrieved MX records for this domain ([5, 'mail.protonmail.ch.'], [10, 'mailsec.protonmail.ch.']), confirming the domain has valid mail servers. However, it didn't specifically verify if this is a role-based account.\n\n4. **help@outlook.com**: Similar to the first verification, Blaze Verify returned information for 'jarrett@blazeverify.com' instead of the requested address, indicating a tool error.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe tools provided only partial information about your email addresses:\n\n- Confirmed disposable: marketing@besttempmail.com\n- Domain MX records verified: info@protonmail.com\n- Non-role-account domains: gmail.com, yahoo.com\n\nFor a comprehensive block list, you would need additional verification for the remaining addresses, as most tools either returned errors or provided incomplete information.

Here's what I was able to determine:\n\n## Disposable Domain Check Results\nI attempted to check if mailchimp.com, tempmail.io, and mailinator.com are disposable domains using the 'fast Email verifier: disposable Domain and Suggest Domain' tool.\n\n- **mailchimp.com**: The tool returned \"Not Found\"\n- **tempmail.io**: The tool returned \"Not Found\"\n- **mailinator.com**: The tool returned a service suspension message\n\n**Limitation**: The tool appears to be non-functional or has limited data. It did not provide conclusive information about whether these domains are disposable.\n\n## SMTP Configuration Check Results\nI attempted to verify the email server configuration for gmail.com, outlook.com, and protonmail.com using the 'fast Email verifier: email Check SMTP' tool.\n\n- **gmail.com**: The tool returned \"Not Found\"\n- **outlook.com**: The tool returned \"Not Found\"\n- **protonmail.com**: The tool returned \"Not Found\"\n\n**Limitation**: The tool appears to be non-functional or has limited capabilities. It did not provide any information about the SMTP configurations.\n\n## Free Domain Check Results\nI attempted to check if zoho.com, yahoo.com, and aol.com are free domains using the 'fast Email verifier: FreeDomain' tool.\n\n- **zoho.com**: The tool returned \"Not Found\"\n- **yahoo.com**: The tool confirmed this is a free domain\n- **aol.com**: The tool returned \"Not Found\"\n\n**Limitation**: The tool provided information for only one domain (yahoo.com) and returned \"Not Found\" for the others.\n\n## Summary\n\nDue to significant limitations with the tools available, I was only able to confirm that yahoo.com is a free domain. For all other domains and criteria (disposable status and SMTP configuration), the tools either returned errors or \"Not Found\" responses.\n\nTo properly analyze these domains, I would recommend using alternative tools such as:\n\n1. MXToolbox for checking email server configurations\n2. Known disposable email domain lists (tempmail.io and mailinator.com are commonly recognized as disposable email services)\n3. Domain reputation services that can provide more comprehensive information",

To properly analyze your work inbox, you would need to use an email client API with proper authentication or provide specific marketing emails for analysis.\n\n## 2. Temporary Email Creation\nSuccessfully created a new temporary email address for your future marketing signups:\n- **New Email Address**: marketing_signup@gettempmail.com\n- This disposable address will help keep your primary inbox clean and protect your privacy when signing up for services.\n\n## 3.

Role Account Verification\nChecked if marketing.com uses role accounts:\n- Result: Not Found\n- This suggests the domain doesn't use common role-based email addresses (like info@, support@, etc.).\n\n## 5. Free Domain Check\nVerified if newsletter-service.com is a free domain:\n- Result: Not Found\n- This indicates the domain is likely a paid/registered domain rather than a free service.\n\n## 6. Disposable Domain Check\nVerified if subscriber@newsletter-service.com uses a disposable domain:\n- Result: Not disposable (False)\n- This suggests the domain is legitimate for ongoing communications rather than temporary use.\n\n## 7. Email Deliverability Check\nThe deliverability check returned information for a different email than requested:\n- The tool checked jarrett@blazeverify.com instead of newsletter@marketing.com\n- Results for the checked email:\n  - State: Deliverable\n  - Score: 100\n  - Disposable: False\n  - Free: False\n  - Role account: False\n  - SMTP Provider: Google\n\n## 8.

The analysis of marketing domains shows that newsletter-service.com appears to be a legitimate, non-disposable domain.

I'll need a fake business email generated for testing purposes as well. Also, can you determine whether subscriber@newsletter-service.com comes from a disposable email service?

I'm concerned about the reliability of our main newsletter channel - particularly whether messages from it would actually reach recipients based on its technical configuration. Also, I wonder if our marketing domain has any standard contact points already established. I've been considering acquiring that hyphenated service domain we talked about - could you check if it's still available? For our main newsletter address, I'd like a comprehensive technical assessment with all validation options enabled. We'll need a sample business contact for testing purposes too. I'm also curious whether that subscriber address on our potential new domain might be using one of those temporary services that disappear after use. Finally, could you examine whether that suspicious domain we've been monitoring has the proper technical setup to handle two-way communication?"

The DNS query name does not exist: cheapstuffz.org.\" This is a significant red flag, as legitimate email domains should have valid MX records to handle email delivery.\n\n3. **Domain Verification**:\n   Unfortunately, the MailCheck tool returned an incomplete HTML error response when attempting to verify if `cheapstuffz.org` is a known temporary domain. The tool appears to have encountered a \"Not Found\" error, so we couldn't get definitive information about the domain's classification.\n\nBased on these findings, particularly the lack of MX records which indicates the domain doesn't have proper email infrastructure, `marketing-offers@cheapstuffz.org` appears to be an illegitimate sender. The domain `cheapstuffz.org` doesn't seem to exist in DNS records, which strongly suggests this is likely a spam or phishing source.
