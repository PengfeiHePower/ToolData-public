I'm also curious about another short stretch in Roppongi, between points 139.7010,35.6580 and 139.7010,35.6600. After planning these routes, I'd love to see a detailed view of the Ikebukuro area - specifically centered at 139.7744,35.7120. A high-resolution image would be ideal so I can clearly see the streets and landmarks. Could you make it large enough to see details but still fit on my tablet screen? And maybe mark the exact spot I mentioned so I can easily reference it?"

Also, are there any museums or interesting attractions within the same distance? Again, just the top 20 in English would be perfect.

I'm also interested in the municipal boundaries for a couple other locations I've marked: one near the Portland Art Museum (-122.658430, 45.512231) and another up in the University Park neighborhood (-122.645546, 45.559187). For that first location downtown, I'd also like to know what time zone it's in, since I need to coordinate some calls. As part of my background research, I should probably have a reference table of international location codes for the global context section of my report."

I'm especially interested in what cultural and historical gems, nature spots, entertainment venues, dining options, and shopping experiences I might find within about 3 miles of the city center (around -122.6784, 45.5152). A bird's-eye view of the downtown area would be helpful too."

I'm also intrigued by that trendy former industrial area with all the galleries and lofts (around -122.658722, 45.512230), and that charming tree-lined neighborhood to the west of downtown (near -122.694469, 45.527863). For each area, I'd appreciate seeing a good sampling of what's available. Also, when planning my meals, I should probably know what time zone the locals operate on there."

I'd like to design a scenic drive that avoids major highways, starting from that historic university neighborhood in the northwest (38.9097,-77.0653), passing by where Congress meets (38.8976,-77.0366), then across the river to that historically significant neighborhood (38.8862,-76.9965), before returning to our starting point. For our international visitors' reference materials, we'll need that comprehensive list of global country codes. Also, could you pinpoint these three landmarks on our map? There's that spot on Wisconsin Avenue (1234), the address on Connecticut Avenue (1600), and that location on Pennsylvania Avenue SE (700) - all in Washington DC."

I'd like to know what addresses these coordinates correspond to. Also, can you provide some neighborhood information about Rosslyn, Clarendon, and Crystal City in Arlington, Virginia?

I also retrieved light-colored base map tiles for the same location to use as a foundation. To enhance the mountain visualization, I specifically requested v2 hillshading tiles from Mapilion for this area. I then looked up which zipcode contains these coordinates, and searched for points of interest within a larger bounding box around this region (approximately from -112.0 to -104.5 longitude and 39.5 to 41.5 latitude).

Also, can you identify which county boundaries we'll cross near the coordinates -122.4194,46.5369 along our journey? I'd like to know about amenities in the area too - specifically restaurants, gas stations, and rest areas within the region bounded by -122.9789 to -122.7789 longitude and 46.0169 to 46.2169 latitude. Lastly, to better visualize the terrain around Mount St. Helens, could you provide both hillshading and vector map tiles for the area at coordinates x:84, y:183, z:9?",

Also, I need to pull vector tile data at x=596, y=389, zoom level 10 for more detailed geographical information. While we're at it, would you mind looking up the exact addresses for both cities by reverse geocoding these coordinates: San Francisco (37.7879493,-122.3961974) and New York City (40.7128,-74.0060)? I'd prefer these address details in English. Lastly, can you show me a grayscale version of that same vector tile area (x=596, y=389, zoom level 10) with a ratio of 2 for better visibility?",

For the other city, I'd like to examine the underlying geographical data - that vector information at coordinates 596-389 with zoom level 10 should reveal interesting patterns. Also, what exactly would someone write as the formal address if they were standing at those coordinates in the Financial District (37.7879493,-122.3961974)? And similarly, what would be the precise location description for someone at the heart of Manhattan (40.7128,-74.0060)? To complete my comparison, I'd appreciate seeing that same New York area (596-389, zoom 10) in that minimalist grayscale style with the doubled clarity ratio - it helps highlight the urban density patterns."

Could you map out the best route from coordinates 139.795,35.633 to 139.645,35.861? I'm fine with taking toll roads if that's more efficient. While I'm in the area, I'd also like to visit the Gundam Factory Yokohama - what's its precise location? Finally, I need to know about public transportation options near my meeting point at coordinates 139.711,35.685 - what are the three closest train stations to that location?",

My delivery truck is quite substantial - about the size of a small shipping container and weighs as much as 10 cars. I don't mind taking toll roads if it's more efficient. Also, I'm hoping to visit that life-sized robot attraction in Yokohama during my downtime - the one where they built that famous anime mecha. And since I'll be spending some time around coordinates 139.711,35.685, I'm curious which railway stations I could use to get around from there - just the closest few would be helpful."

Can you create hillshading map tiles for the Seattle and Boston areas so I can visualize the terrain? I'll need timezone information for Seattle and Boston based on their coordinates too. Lastly, I'm thinking of taking a specific route - would you mind calculating an optimized driving path from Seattle to Boston that passes through Missoula, Fargo, Minneapolis, Chicago, and Cleveland?",

I'd also like to visualize the terrain using a hillshading raster tile (version 2) at zoom level 11 for map coordinates x=472, y=781.

I'm curious about the residential zones surrounding the heart of the city (39.7392, -104.9903) - specifically within about a 5-mile reach. It would be helpful to see the complete boundary information for analysis. Also, I'd like to visualize the topographical features of the area - perhaps something that shows the elevation changes around map section 472-781 at zoom 11? For my presentation materials, I'll need proper labeling with the standard character set (0-255) in Roboto Regular. And since I'll be coordinating with colleagues, knowing which time zone this urban center falls into would help schedule our virtual meetings appropriately."

For my digital travel journal, I'd also like to include a topographical visualization - specifically that hillshading tile from version 2, zoom level 12, at coordinates 2048,1361.

I'm wondering about possible paths from that popular South Rim lookout to the main Visitor Center. For my mapping app, I need that specific vector tile data (the one at x=102, y=205, z=10). Also, what are the exact coordinates of that university town south of the canyon where many tourists stay? I'm curious about the administrative boundaries near the area where most visitors first enter the park. Once I have a suggested path, I'd like to know how much elevation change I'll face during my hike. And finally, what interesting landmarks might I encounter around the main village area where most tourists gather?"

I also need information about Shinjuku station itself, both using the Japanese name '\u65b0\u5bbf' and the English name 'Shinjuku Station, Tokyo'. I'm planning to walk from coordinates 139.7005,35.6897 to 139.7100,35.6850, so could you calculate a high-priority route (priority 100) between those points? Additionally, I'd appreciate seeing a winter terrain visualization for the same map tile coordinates but with a higher resolution ratio of 2. Finally, could you tell me exactly which neighborhood the coordinates 139.7005,35.6897 fall within? I want to be precise about the area I'm researching.",

They specifically searched for Shinjuku station information in both Japanese ('\u65b0\u5bbf') and English ('Shinjuku Station, Tokyo'). The user then calculated a route between coordinates 139.7005,35.6897 and 139.7100,35.6850 with high priority (100), likely representing a walking path near Shinjuku Station. They also requested winter terrain visualization for the same map tile coordinates with a higher resolution ratio (2).

By the way, locals write the station name as '\u65b0\u5bbf' - I wonder what information comes up when searching for that versus 'Shinjuku Station, Tokyo'? If I wanted to walk from point 139.7005,35.6897 to point 139.7100,35.6850 (which I think is near the station), what would that route look like?

Could you look up the addresses for San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose using their coordinates? I'd also like to know the timezone information for each city. While you're at it, can you pull up a hillshading map tile that shows the whole region? I'm curious about what's nearby - would you mind showing me all the available categories of places and then identifying what's within 1km of San Francisco? Lastly, I need to figure out my driving route from San Francisco to Oakland, but I want to swing by San Jose along the way.",

Would that make for a good tour of Calgary's landmarks?"

I'd also like to examine the broader terrain context by pulling vector and hillshading tiles for the region (tile coordinates x:168, y:388, z:10).

I'm also curious about the broader geographic context - specifically that map section at x:168, y:388, z:10 - both in terms of vector data and how the hills create shadows across the landscape. For my research project, I need to understand the ups and downs of five specific spots in the downtown core.

To complete my geographic study, I'd appreciate both the vector representation and terrain data for this same region."

There are two spots near the main hub (at 35.689,139.700 and another slightly northeast at 35.690,139.702) where I'm curious about the height above sea level. I need to travel from the historic central station (35.6762,139.7512) to the western part of this district (35.6896,139.7006) by car, but I'm on a budget and want to avoid extra charges. What's the exact position of those distinctive twin government towers at that '6 Chome-1-1' address in the western part? I'd also like to cycle from coordinates 139.7022,35.6833 to 139.7006,35.6896 - what's the best route? And in case of emergency, what medical facilities are available in this vibrant area?"

For my presentation, I'd also like to include a visual representation of the terrain - specifically that tile showing the hills and valleys at zoom level 15 (I believe it's tile 5242-12879 in the newer version of the mapping system). Also, I need to properly cite which county jurisdiction this neighborhood falls under in my report - the center of my study area is approximately at that spot where my friend took a photo with GPS coordinates showing 37.755 north, 122.445 west."

They then explored conflict data by requesting the geographical boundaries of armed conflicts in the region. Following this, they created a series of points along a line from Kharkiv (50.0055,36.2310) to what appears to be Donetsk region (48.0159,37.8028), placing 21 equidistant points at 5km intervals. They also queried specific Ukrainian census tract boundaries (UA4801, UA4802, UA4803) and retrieved a comprehensive country list with ISO codes. Additionally, they plotted points in four cardinal directions (north, east, south, west) at 10km distances from the Kharkiv coordinates.

I'd appreciate a detailed visual representation of this urban center - something high-definition that shows street-level details (something like twice the standard resolution would be perfect). Also, what notable locations exist within about 10km of this city center? I'm curious about the broader administrative region too - what points of interest can be found in the rectangular area between approximately 36\u00b0E,48\u00b0N and 38\u00b0E,50.1\u00b0N? If someone needed to travel by car from this northeastern city to another major city further east (the one in the Donbas coal region), what would be the most efficient path?

Additionally, they planned a bike route from downtown Seattle (-122.33551,47.60621) to north Seattle (-122.28961,47.65577) and performed bulk geocoding for multiple Belltown neighborhood addresses (2100 1st Ave and 2401 2nd Ave).",

    "simple_rewrite": "I'm planning a bike trip around Seattle and need some help with the geography and route planning. Could you pull up a terrain raster map tile for coordinates z=15, x=5240, y=11409 so I can see the topography? I'd also like to explore different route options from south Seattle (-122.30897,47.44997) to downtown (-122.33551,47.60621), including any toll preferences I should know about. While I'm planning, can you locate bike stations in Seattle and identify any commercial spots, restaurants, and entertainment venues within 300 meters of Pike Place Market (coordinates -122.34889,47.62051)? To better visualize the terrain, I'd appreciate a hillshading tile for coordinates z=10, x=655, y=356. I'm also curious about ZIP code 98109 - what information can you provide about that area? And could you retrieve the tile JSON for vector map style v3? One more thing - I need to map out a bike route from downtown Seattle (-122.33551,47.60621) to the University District (-122.28961,47.65577). Oh, and I'm considering stopping in Belltown - would you mind geocoding these two addresses: 2100 1st Ave and 2401 2nd Ave in Seattle, WA? Please include the address number, street address, and city in the results.",
    "hard_rewrite": "I'm planning a cycling adventure around the Emerald City and need to understand the lay of the land. Could you pull up a detailed view of the hills and valleys for that specific square of the city grid (you know, that 15th zoom level at 5240-east, 11409-south)? I'm trying to visualize what I'd be up against. I'm considering a journey from that spot in south Seattle to the downtown area, and I'd like to know my options - especially if there are ways to avoid toll roads. Also, where might I find stations throughout the city? I'm particularly interested in finding shops, restaurants, and entertainment within a short walking distance of that famous fish-throwing market. To better understand the broader terrain features, could you show me that hillshade visualization for the wider region (that level 10 view at coordinates 655-east, 356-south)? I'm also curious about what's in that 98109 area. For the map styling, could you pull up that vector tile information for the v3 style? I'm thinking about riding from downtown to the university area - what would that route look like for a cyclist? Lastly, I need to pinpoint those two Belltown addresses - the one at 2100 on 1st and the other at 2401 on 2nd - with just their basic address details."
