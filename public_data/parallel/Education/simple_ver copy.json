Could you help me find information about schools in East Java province (code 050000), specifically showing the number of schools across different cities and districts? I'd also like to dig deeper into Surabaya (code 056000) to see how many schools are in each sub-district. Once we have that overview, I'm particularly interested in seeing a list of specific schools located in the Gubeng sub-district (code 056010). On a related note, I've been coming across some Indonesian slang in my research - what does the word 'gokil' mean? Lastly, I'd appreciate if you could pull up about 3 recent pronunciation posts from thefluentme on the first page to help with my language studies.",

Next, I generated 8 fill-in-the-blank questions from a text about solar observation, which covered topics like scientific instruments, solar phenomena, space weather impacts, and modern observatories. I also used the Numbers Translator tool to convert the numerical digits '7294538621' into their word form representation. Additionally, I accessed Japanese kanji characters at the grade 2 level using the Kanji alive web application. Finally, I executed a Python code that calculates the distance light travels in one year by multiplying the speed of light (299,792,458 meters per second) by the number of seconds in a year, converting the result to kilometers.",

I'm also researching solar phenomena, so I'd love to see 5 recent observation videos from Helioviewer's YouTube channel and a comprehensive list of available solar data sources, particularly including Yohkoh, STEREO_A, and STEREO_B data. While you're at it, can you verify if Helioviewer has YouTube authorization in my current session? For my teaching materials, I need 5 fill-in-the-blank questions about the solar system based on the text I'm providing about planets, the Sun, and their characteristics. On a different note, I'm studying Arabic (language ID: 2) and would appreciate some information about it. I'm also interested in reviewing some DEI success stories from page 1 for a diversity initiative. Lastly, could you create some blank field questions from this text about the solar system for a quiz I'm developing? Additionally, using thefluentme, please pull pronunciation posts from thefluentme.",

Jack Copeland', 'description': \"Alan Turing was one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. In 1935, aged 22, he developed the mathematical theory upon which all subsequent stored-program digital computers are modeled. At the outbreak of hostilities with Germany in September 1939, he joined the Goverment Codebreaking team at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire and played a crucial role in deciphering Engima, the code used by the German armed forces to protect their radio communications. Turing's work on the version of Enigma used by the German navy was vital to the battle for supremacy in the North Atlantic. He also contributed to the attack on the cyphers known as 'Fish,' which were used by the German High Command for the encryption of signals during the latter part of the war. His contribution helped to shorten the war in Europe by an estimated two years. After the war, his theoretical work led to the development of Britain's first computers at the National Physical Laboratory and the Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at Manchester University. Turing was also a founding father of modern cognitive science, theorizing that the cortex at birth is an 'unorganized machine' which through 'training' becomes organized 'into a universal machine or something like it.' He went on to develop the use of computers to model biological growth, launching the discipline now referred to as Artificial Life. The papers in this book are the key works for understanding Turing's phenomenal contribution across all these fields. The collection includes Turing's declassified wartime 'Treatise on the Enigma'; letters from Turing to Churchill and to codebreakers; lectures, papers, and broadcasts which opened up the concept of AI and its implications; and the paper which formed the genesis of the investigation of Artifical Life.\", 'img_link': 'https://library.lol/covers/0/553907cdf5f03af78950561f42f1571a-"

Next, generate 5 fill-in-the-blank questions from this text about space exploration history: 'Space exploration began in earnest with the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union in 1957. NASA was established in 1958 as a response to the Soviet space program. The Apollo 11 mission in 1969 successfully landed astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon. The Space Shuttle program ran from 1981 to 2011, with two major disasters: Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003. The International Space Station, a joint project involving five space agencies, has been continuously occupied since November 2000. SpaceX became the first private company to send astronauts to the ISS in 2020 with their Crew Dragon spacecraft.' Also, retrieve page 1 of diversity, equity, and inclusion learning resources. Then check the latest news from the Helioviewer Project blog. Finally, look up the Japanese onyomi reading '\u30a6\u30c1\u30e5\u30a6' and search for the meaning of the Turkish word 'astronomi'.",

For my teaching materials, I'd appreciate having five fill-in-the-blank questions created from a text about space exploration history, covering the timeline from Sputnik through SpaceX's first crewed mission. Additionally, I'm looking to incorporate diversity and inclusion learning resources into my curriculum. To stay current, could you check the Helioviewer Project's news feed for recent solar science updates? Finally, I'm adding a multilingual component to my project, so I'd like to understand the Japanese onyomi reading '\u30a6\u30c1\u30e5\u30a6' which I believe relates to 'universe,' and find out what 'astronomi' means in Turkish.

Lastly, my students use a lot of slang, so I'd like to look up what 'cap' means in contemporary usage through the Urban Dictionary API.
