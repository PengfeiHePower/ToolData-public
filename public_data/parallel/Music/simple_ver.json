The tool returned data about her albums but appears to have been cut off mid-response. Based on the available information, here are Billie Eilish's main albums:\n\n- **HIT ME HARD AND SOFT** - Her most recent album\n- **Happier Than Ever** - Marked as explicit content\n- **WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?** - Her breakthrough album\n\nUnfortunately, the tool response was incomplete, so information about her singles, videos, and related artists was not provided. The data also lacks release years and complete details about her top releases.\n\n## 2. Most Streamed Songs on Spotify from 2020\n\nThe MusicData API successfully retrieved information about the most streamed songs on Spotify from 2020, when the pandemic started. Here are the top songs:\n\n1. **The Weeknd - Blinding Lights** (4,518,199,117 streams, 1,813,708 daily)\n2. **Glass Animals - Heat Waves** (3,170,674,064 streams, 1,142,091 daily)\n3. **Dua Lipa - Levitating** (2,175,048,691 streams, 560,769 daily)\n4. **The Weeknd - Save Your Tears** (2,140,208,617 streams, 1,108,953 daily)\n5. **Bad Bunny - D\u00c1KITI** (2,069,113,295 streams, 621,952 daily)\n6. **BTS - Dynamite** (1,947,622,983 streams, 626,426 daily)\n7. **Lauv - I Like Me Better** (1,854,997,960 streams, 565,014 daily)\n8. **Conan Gray - Heather** (1,805,576,534 streams, 1,204,255 daily)\n9. **Ava Max - Sweet but Psycho** (1,750,480,784 streams, 988,255 daily)\n10. **Powfu - death bed (coffee for your head)** (1,725,602,267 streams, 568,130 daily)\n\nThe list continues through rank 18, but appears to be cut off mid-response, so we don't have the complete top 20 or top 50 list. The data shows The Weeknd dominated 2020 streaming with multiple entries in the top rankings.\n\n## 3. Independent Albums Charting (December 2023)\n\nUnfortunately, the Billboard API for Independent Albums returned an error: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\" This means we were unable to retrieve data about which independent albums were charting during the first week of December 2023.\n\n## Summary\n\nYour college project on music industry trends can include partial information about Billie Eilish's discography and comprehensive data about the most streamed songs on Spotify from 2020. However, there are significant limitations to the data collected:\n\n1. The Billie Eilish information is incomplete, missing details about singles, videos, and release years.\n2. The Spotify streaming data appears comprehensive but may be missing some entries from the complete list.\n3. No information was available about independent albums charting in December 2023 due to an API error.\n\nTo complete your analysis of how mainstream artists, streaming trends, and independent music scenes have evolved, you would need to gather additional data, particularly regarding the independent music scene which is completely missing from this report.",

Billboard Global 200 Top Songs\n\nI retrieved the Billboard Global 200 chart from October 15, 2023. Here are the top songs trending globally at that time:\n\n1. \"IDGAF\" by Drake Featuring Yeat (1st week on chart)\n2. \"First Person Shooter\" by Drake Featuring J. Cole (1st week on chart)\n3. \"Paint The Town Red\" by Doja Cat (10 weeks on chart, previously ranked #2)\n4. \"Virginia Beach\" by Drake (1st week on chart)\n5. \"3D\" by Jung Kook & Jack Harlow (2 weeks on chart, previously ranked #1)\n6. \"Greedy\" by Tate McRae (4 weeks on chart, previously ranked #4)\n7. \"You & Me\" by Jennie (new entry)\n\n**Limitation**: The tool only returned the top 7 songs from the Billboard Global 200 chart, not the complete list of 200 songs. Also, this data is from October 2023, so it's not current.\n\n## 2. Radio Station Genres\n\nI searched for children-specific radio station genres and found only one result:\n- \"Children's Family\" (Genre ID: 90)\n\n**Limitation**: I specifically searched for children-related genres, which returned only one result. The tool has many more genres available, but I would need to perform a broader search without the \"children\" keyword to retrieve a more diverse list of music genres for your event.\n\n## 3. Lyrics for \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\"\n\nUnfortunately, the tool returned no results when searching for the lyrics to \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.\"\n\n**Error**: The lyrics search tool returned an empty data set, meaning it couldn't find the requested song in its database.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your children's music event, I've provided some trending songs from the Billboard Global 200 (though the data is from October 2023). I found that there is a specific \"Children's Family\" radio genre you could explore. Unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve the lyrics for \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" using the available tools.

The snippets show recurring themes of:\n\n- Emotional support and sacrifice: \"Found you when your heart was broke/I filled your cup until it overflowed\"\n- Feeling taken advantage of: \"Put you right back on your feet/Just so you could take advantage of me\"\n- Power dynamics in relationships: \"Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?/Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me\"\n- Betrayal and discovery: \"You don't have to say just what you did/I already know\"\n\nThese snippets demonstrate Halsey's direct, conversational lyrical style that often addresses a specific person and explores complex relationship dynamics.\n\n## 2. Afrobeats Billboard Chart (October 15, 2022)\n\nUnfortunately, the Billboard API tool returned an error message: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\" This means we were unable to retrieve information about trending Afrobeats songs for the week of October 15, 2022.

Instead of returning information about 'Last Last' by Burna Boy, the tool returned details about a different song called 'Lil Bae' by LuhMelly. The output was also cut off mid-response. \n\nThe tool may have received incorrect parameters (the song key '615506448' might not correspond to Burna Boy's 'Last Last') or there was an error in processing the request.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your music discovery presentation, you have useful lyric snippets from Halsey's 'Without Me' that showcase her songwriting style focusing on relationship dynamics and emotional vulnerability. However, you'll need to seek alternative sources for information about trending Afrobeats songs from October 2022 and details about Burna Boy's 'Last Last' as the tools were unable to provide this information successfully.",

    "final_answer": "# Comprehensive Music Report Analysis\n\n## 1. Billboard Catalog Albums Chart\n\nThe Billboard API returned data for the Catalog Albums chart from October 8, 2022 (not current data). This limitation means we're looking at older trends rather than the most recent comeback albums. Here are the top albums making a comeback at that time:\n\n1. \"Dirt\" by Alice In Chains (1st week at #1, 30 weeks on chart)\n2. \"Starboy\" by The Weeknd (peaked at #1, 109 weeks on chart)\n3. \"Ctrl\" by SZA (peaked at #1, 192 weeks on chart)\n4. \"Greatest Hits\" by Queen (peaked at #1, impressive 841 weeks on chart)\n5. \"Curtain Call: The Hits\" by Eminem (peaked at #1, 470 weeks on chart)\n6. \"good kid, m.A.A.d city\" by Kendrick Lamar (peaked at #1, 364 weeks on chart)\n7. \"Rumours\" by Fleetwood Mac (peaked at #1, 433 weeks on chart)\n8. \"YHLQMDLG\" by Bad Bunny (incomplete data)\n\nNote that the API response was cut off after the 8th entry, so we don't have the complete chart data.\n\n## 2. Taylor Swift vs. The Weeknd on Spotify\n\nThe Spotify API provided current popularity metrics for both artists:\n\n### Taylor Swift:\n- Followers: 141,679,891\n- Popularity score: 99/100\n- Profile: https://open.spotify.com/artist/06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02\n\n### The Weeknd:\n- Followers: 109,596,823\n- Popularity score: 97/100\n- Profile: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\n\nUnfortunately, the API response did not include genre information for either artist, which limits our ability to compare their musical styles. Taylor Swift has approximately 32 million more followers than The Weeknd, though both maintain extremely high popularity scores.\n\n## 3. Radio Dosis Mix Stream\n\nThe tool attempted to stream Radio Dosis Mix but returned binary/encoded data rather than a usable streaming link. This appears to be raw audio data that cannot be properly displayed or used in this format. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a functional link for background music while you work.\n\n## 4. YouTube Music Videos (Week 30, 2023)\n\nThe MusicData API provided the most viewed YouTube music videos for the 30th week of 2023 (late July). Here are the top trending videos:\n\n1. \"LALA\" by Myke Towers - 30,853,217 views (up 2 positions)\n2. \"Seven (feat. Latto)\" by Jung Kook - 25,263,537 views (down 1 position)\n3. \"Kaavaalaa\" from JAILER - 21,248,144 views (up 1 position)\n4. \"La Bebe (Remix)\" by Yng Lvcas & Peso Pluma - 18,877,130 views (up 2 positions)\n5. \"Har Har Mahadev\" from OMG 2 - 18,142,104 views (new entry)\n6. \"UN X100TO\" by Grupo Frontera x Bad Bunny - 16,094,437 views (up 1 position)\n7. Incomplete data for 7th position and beyond\n\nNote that the API response was cut off after the 6th entry, so we don't have the complete list of trending videos.\n\n## Summary\n\nYour music report has some valuable data points but also significant limitations. The Billboard data is from October 2022 rather than current, the Spotify artist comparison lacks genre information, the Radio Dosis stream link is unusable, and both the Billboard and YouTube data are incomplete. \n\nFor your cross-platform analysis, you can highlight how The Weeknd appears both in the catalog charts (\"Starboy\" at #2) and maintains high current popularity on Spotify. Latin music was clearly dominating YouTube in July 2023, with artists like Myke Towers, Peso Pluma, and Bad Bunny in the top positions. For a more comprehensive report, you would need more current Billboard data and complete listings from both charts.",

Also, I'd love to compare the current fan bases of that Canadian R&B artist who did 'Blinding Lights' versus the songwriter behind 'All Too Well'. While working on this research, I could use some background music - perhaps that continuous mix from that Latin station?

You might want to try broader search terms like \"Latin pop\" for more options.\n\n## Featured Trending Radio Stations (Limited to 5)\n\nHere are 5 currently featured radio stations you might want to check out:\n\n1. **Gartenwelt Frey**\n   - Genre: Dance\n   - Country: Germany\n   - Stream URL: http://stream.laut.fm/gartenweltfrey\n\n2. **Depor Fans Radio**\n   - Genre: Rock\n   - Country: Spain (Espa\u00f1a)\n   - Stream URL: http://stream.zeno.fm/s6cmbbdrcphvv\n\n3. **Metro 95.1**\n   - Genre: Talk\n   - Country: Argentina\n   - Stream URL: http://playerservices.streamtheworld.com/api/livestream-redirect/METRO.mp3\n\n4. **Soft Radio**\n   - Genre: African\n   - Country: Uganda\n   - Stream URL: http://stream.zeno.fm/8ybc1t1m8yzuv\n\n5. **[Station name missing]**\n   - **Note:** The tool returned incomplete information for the 5th station.\n\nThese stations offer a diverse mix of genres and countries that could provide interesting background music for your event.",

Unfortunately, the tool returned no results (`'total': 0, 'data': []`). This could be due to limitations in the database or an issue with the search parameters. To understand local music trends in Jakarta, you may need to try alternative sources or modify your search criteria.\n\n## 2. Children's Songs by Composer Bellman\n\nThe kjoller tool successfully retrieved information about a children's song composed by C.M. Bellman:\n\n- **Song Title**: \"Bj\u00f8rnen sover\" (The Bear Sleeps)\n- **Melody by**: C.M. Bellman\n- **Tags**: klasiker, dyr (classic, animals)\n- **Lyrics**: The song is in Danish and describes a sleeping bear. The lyrics warn that while the bear isn't dangerous if you're careful, you can never fully trust it.\n\nThis song would be appropriate for your family-friendly segment. Note that only one song was returned, which may indicate a limited database or that Bellman has few children's compositions in this particular database.\n\n## 3.

    "final_answer": "# Comprehensive Music Report: K-pop Landscape and Global Music Trends\n\n## BTS: K-pop Representative\n\nThe K-POP boy-groups tool provided key information about BTS:\n\n- **Group Name**: BTS (Bangtan Boys / \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8)\n- **Debut Date**: June 13, 2013\n- **Company**: Big Hit\n- **Members**: 7 (all original members remain)\n- **Fanclub Name**: ARMY\n- **Status**: Active\n\nThis data confirms BTS's longevity in the industry, maintaining their original lineup over a decade after debut, which is relatively rare in K-pop.\n\n## Similar Artists (Spotify Radio)\n\nThe Spotify Get Radio Playlist tool returned a playlist based on BTS's style:\n\n- A single playlist URI was returned: spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E4rlkYj6ItCDn\n\n**Limitation**: The tool only provided the playlist URI without listing the actual artists or tracks included. This limits our ability to analyze similar artists in detail without accessing the actual playlist contents.\n\n## Billboard Catalog Albums Chart Analysis\n\nThe Billboard API returned the Catalog Albums chart for the week of October 8, 2022:\n\n**Top Albums with Longevity**:\n1. \"Dirt\" by Alice In Chains (30 weeks on chart)\n2. \"Starboy\" by The Weeknd (109 weeks)\n3. \"Ctrl\" by SZA (192 weeks)\n4. \"Greatest Hits\" by Queen (841 weeks)\n5. \"Curtain Call: The Hits\" by Eminem (470 weeks)\n6. \"good kid, m.A.A.d city\" by Kendrick Lamar (364 weeks)\n7. \"Rumours\" by Fleetwood Mac (433 weeks)\n8. \"YHLQMDLG\" by Bad Bunny (partial data)\n\n**Limitations**: \n- The data is from October 2022, not current.\n- The entry for Bad Bunny was cut off mid-response.\n- No K-pop artists appear in the provided portion of the chart, limiting our East-West comparison.\n\n## Taylor Swift: Western Music Industry Comparison\n\nThe Spotify Artist Details tool provided comprehensive information about Taylor Swift:\n\n- **Followers**: 79,976,094\n- **Genres**: Pop\n- **Popularity Score**: 100/100 (maximum)\n- **Official Spotify URL**: https://open.spotify.com/artist/06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02\n\nThis data shows Taylor Swift's immense global popularity and mainstream classification as a pop artist.\n\n## Summary: K-pop and Global Music Industry Comparison\n\nBased on the available data, we can observe that both BTS and Taylor Swift represent pinnacles of success in their respective music industries. BTS has maintained remarkable stability with their original lineup since 2013, while Taylor Swift has achieved maximum popularity metrics on Spotify with nearly 80 million followers.\n\nThe Billboard Catalog Albums chart demonstrates the longevity potential of Western music, with albums like Queen's \"Greatest Hits\" remaining charted for over 16 years (841 weeks). This provides context for analyzing how K-pop albums might perform in terms of long-term cultural impact.\n\nHowever, significant limitations in the data prevent a truly comprehensive comparison. We lack current Billboard data, complete information about similar artists to BTS, and direct metrics comparing BTS's global performance to Taylor Swift's. A more complete analysis would require additional current chart data and streaming metrics for both artists.",

Radio Dosis Music Stream\n\nThe Radio Dosis tool attempted to provide a continuous music stream, but the output contains binary/encoded data that cannot be directly played in this format. The stream appears to have been successfully accessed, but the binary audio data cannot be rendered in text format.\n\n## Summary\n\nYour March 2023 music report shows Morgan Wallen dominated the Billboard 200 with his new album \"One Thing At A Time\" while also maintaining a strong presence on YouTube Music trends. There's an interesting overlap between traditional charts and streaming platforms, with artists like Taylor Swift and Morgan Wallen appearing prominently in both Billboard and YouTube rankings. For piano compositions, Ludovico Einaudi maintains a significant presence on SoundCloud with over 2 million followers and nearly 600 tracks available. Unfortunately, the Radio Dosis stream cannot be directly accessed through this interface due to the binary nature of audio data.",

While we're at it, can you look up the classical composer Ludovico Einaudi on SoundCloud, but just show me the top 10 users? To wrap things up, I'd love to tune into the Emisora Radio Dosis mix stream for some background music while I review all this information.",
    "hard_rewrite": "I'm exploring the musical landscape of early 2023 and wondering what albums were making waves in mid-March. Also curious about which artists are currently capturing America's attention on streaming platforms. I've been hearing about this Italian pianist who composes minimalist contemporary classical pieces - I think his last name starts with 'E' - and would love to discover who's sharing his work on that orange-logoed audio platform. To wind down my musical journey, I'd like to immerse myself in a continuous stream of curated sounds from that Latin American radio station with 'Dosis' in its name."

The full dataset likely contains more artists.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- Latin artists dominate the top positions (Bad Bunny, Karol G, Shakira)\n- K-pop acts (Blackpink, BTS) maintain strong global presence\n- The top 10 artists collectively generated over 41 billion views\n\n## 2.

Daddy Yankee | 96.5 |\n| 3 | Ed Sheeran - Shape of You | 97.4 |\n| 4 | J Balvin, Willy William - Mi Gente | 102.7 |\n| 5 | Luis Fonsi, Demi Lovato - \u00c9chame La Culpa | 110.7 |\n| 6 | DJ Snake - Taki Taki ft.

Cardi B | 129.0 |\n| 10 | Justin Bieber - Sorry | 136.2 |\n\n**Note:** The data appears to be truncated at the 14th video, with the last complete entry being Maluma's \"Coraz\u00f3n\" at 153.1 days. PSY's \"Gangnam Style\" appears to be cut off mid-entry.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- Adele's \"Hello\" holds the record at 87.4 days\n- Latin music videos represent 7 of the top 10 fastest videos\n- Collaborative tracks with multiple artists tend to reach 1B views faster\n\n## 3. Current Billboard 200 Chart\n\nThe Billboard 200 chart data from November 15, 2023 shows the following top albums:\n\n| Rank | Artist | Album | Last Week | Peak Position |\n|------|--------|-------|-----------|---------------|\n| 1 | Taylor Swift | 1989 (Taylor's Version) | 1 | 2 |\n| 2 | Jung Kook | Golden | 2 | 1 |\n| 3 | Drake | For All The Dogs | 1 | 5 |\n| 4 | Morgan Wallen | One Thing At A Time | 1 | 36 |\n| 5 | Bad Bunny | Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va A Pasar Manana | 1 | - |\n\n**Note:** The data is incomplete, showing only the top 5 albums on the Billboard 200 chart. Additionally, some information appears to be missing or inconsistent (e.g., peak positions don't align logically with current rankings).\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- Taylor Swift's re-recorded album maintains the #1 position\n- K-pop artist Jung Kook holds strong at #2\n- The top 5 features diverse genres including pop, K-pop, hip-hop, country, and Latin music\n\n## 4. Countries with Radio Stations\n\nThe Radio World API provided information about countries with radio stations:\n\n| Country | Total Radio Stations | Country ID |\n|---------|---------------------|------------|\n| Afghanistan | 10 | 230 |\n| Albania | 54 | 229 |\n| Algeria | 77 | 228 |\n| American Samoa | 3 | 227 |\n| Andorra | 13 | 226 |\n| Angola | 23 | 225 |\n| Anguilla | 1 | 224 |\n| Antigua and Barbuda | 20 | 223 |\n| Argentina | - | 222 |\n\n**Note:** The data is significantly truncated, showing only 9 countries out of a reported total of 219 countries in the database. The information for Argentina is incomplete. The API indicates there are over 75,000 radio stations worldwide in the complete database.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- The database contains radio station information for 219 countries\n- Coverage varies significantly by country (from 1 station in Anguilla to 77 in Algeria among the visible data)\n- Daily updates add approximately 100 new stations weekly\n\n## 5. Children's Music Albums Titled 'Sing Along'\n\nThe kjoller API was queried for children's albums titled 'Sing Along', but returned no results:\n\n```\n{'status': 'OK', 'data': []}\n```\n\n**Key Insight:** Despite receiving an 'OK' status, the API did not return any children's albums with the exact title 'Sing Along'. This suggests either:\n- No albums with this exact title exist in the database\n- The search parameters may need refinement (e.g., partial matching)\n- The database may have limited coverage of children's music\n\n## Summary\n\nThis report provides valuable insights for your global entertainment company across multiple music metrics, though with some limitations in the data:\n\n1. **Current Popularity Trends:** Latin artists dominate YouTube views in 2023, with Bad Bunny leading at nearly 7 billion views. K-pop acts maintain strong global presence.\n\n2. **Viral Content Patterns:** The fastest videos to reach 1 billion views are predominantly Latin music collaborations, with Adele's \"Hello\" being the notable exception and record holder.\n\n3. **Album Performance:** Taylor Swift, Jung Kook, Drake, Morgan Wallen, and Bad Bunny lead the Billboard 200 chart as of November 2023, representing diverse genres with global appeal.\n\n4. **International Broadcasting:** The database contains information on radio stations across 219 countries, though our view was limited to only 9 countries. This represents a significant opportunity for global broadcasting strategies.\n\n5. **Family-Friendly Content:** No children's albums titled exactly 'Sing Along' were found, suggesting either a gap in the market or a need for broader search parameters when evaluating family-friendly content opportunities.",

If you want to access this endpoint, please upgrade your plan.\" I couldn't retrieve the Spanish songs that were trending in early May 2022 as requested.\n\n## Currently Popular Artists on Genius\nThe Genius - Song Lyrics: Chart: Artists tool returned an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error. This means I couldn't retrieve information about which artists are currently most popular on Genius for your party planning.\n\n## Songs Related to Coldplay's 'Viva La Vida'\nThe YouTube Music API tool returned related songs, but there appears to be a mismatch in the data. The results show songs by Sido, Eko Fresh, and other German artists, which don't seem related to Coldplay's 'Viva La Vida'. Additionally, the output was cut off mid-response, providing only partial information. This suggests either an incorrect browse_id parameter was used or the tool didn't function as expected.\n\n## Global Hits from September 2020\nThe Billboard Global Excl. US chart from September 19, 2020 (when Billboard first started tracking global hits excluding the US) shows these top songs:\n\n1. \"Hawai\" by Maluma\n2. \"Dynamite\" by BTS\n3. \"WAP\" by Cardi B featuring Megan Thee Stallion\n4. \"Mood\" by 24kGoldn featuring iann dior\n5. \"Savage Love (Laxed - Siren Beat)\" by Jawsh 685 x Jason Derulo\n6. \"Ice Cream\" by BLACKPINK X Selena Gomez\n7. \"Blinding Lights\" by The Weeknd\n8. \"Relacion\" by Sech, Daddy Yankee & J Balvin featuring Rosalia & Farruko\n\nNote that this output was also cut off after the 8th entry.\n\n## Latin Jazz Artists for Cocktail Hour\nThe MusiclinkssApi search returned several Latin jazz artists you could feature in your cocktail hour playlist:\n\n1. Maysa\n2. Latin Jazz Instrumental (appears to be a group/collection)\n3. Jazzy Background Artists\n4. The Latin Jazz Cafe\n5. Luna\n6. Cal Tjader (notable vibraphonist known for Latin jazz)\n7. Pete Escovedo (legendary Latin jazz percussionist)\n8. Latin Jazz Instrumentals (appears to be a collection)\n\nThis list was also cut off, suggesting there were more results available.\n\n## Summary\nFor your music-themed party, I was able to provide some global hits from September 2020 (when Billboard first started tracking global charts) and several Latin jazz artists for your cocktail hour. Unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve information about Spanish songs from May 2022 due to access limitations, nor could I get data about currently popular artists on Genius due to a server error.

Top Artists on YouTube in 2022\n\nThe MusicData API provided comprehensive information about the most popular artists on YouTube in 2022, including featured appearances. Here are the top 30 artists based on total views:\n\n| Ranking | Artist | Views |\n|---------|--------|-------|\n| 1 | Bad Bunny | 10,046,995,039 |\n| 2 | Blackpink | 4,726,453,501 |\n| 3 | BTS | 4,719,656,705 |\n| 4 | Karol G | 4,164,397,009 |\n| 5 | Anuel AA | 3,626,724,216 |\n| 6 | Ozuna | 3,584,734,537 |\n| 7 | Mar\u00edlia Mendon\u00e7a | 3,584,311,797 |\n| 8 | J Balvin | 3,582,202,931 |\n| 9 | Daddy Yankee | 3,514,088,277 |\n| 10 | Rauw Alejandro | 3,194,700,937 |\n\nThe data shows Latin artists dominated YouTube in 2022, with Bad Bunny leading by a significant margin. K-pop groups Blackpink and BTS secured the second and third positions respectively.\n\n**Note:** The tool returned only the top 30 artists, with the last entry being truncated. The complete list would likely include more artists.\n\n## 2. Fastest Music Videos to Reach 500 Million Views\n\nThe MusicData API provided information about music videos that reached the 500 million views milestone the fastest:\n\n| Ranking | Video | Days to Reach 500M |\n|---------|-------|-------------------|\n| 1 | Adele - Hello | 34.1 |\n| 2 | Taylor Swift - Look What You Made Me Do | 34.5 |\n| 3 | Nicky Jam x J. Balvin - X (EQUIS) | 44.0 |\n| 4 | DJ Snake - Taki Taki ft. Selena Gomez, Ozuna, Cardi B | 44.6 |\n| 5 | Anuel AA, Daddy Yankee, Karol G, Ozuna & J Balvin - China | 50.2 |\n\nAdele's \"Hello\" holds the record for reaching 500 million views the fastest, in just 34.1 days, closely followed by Taylor Swift's \"Look What You Made Me Do\" at 34.5 days.\n\n**Note:** The tool output was truncated after the 14th entry, so the complete list would include more videos.\n\n## 3. Halsey's 'Badlands (Deluxe Edition)' Album Information\n\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool provided basic information about the album:\n\n- **Album Name:** Badlands (Deluxe Edition)\n- **Release Date:** August 28, 2015\n- **Artist:** Halsey\n- **Number of Songs:** 15\n\n**Note:** The tool only returned the album metadata with song IDs rather than actual song titles or additional album details that would be useful for an artist spotlight section.\n\n## 4. Playlist Related to 'As It Was' by Harry Styles\n\nThe YouTube Music API returned information about the watch playlist associated with Harry Styles' \"As It Was\" (video ID: H5v3kku4y6Q):\n\n- **Playlist ID:** RDAMVMH5v3kku4y6Q\n- **Related Playlist ID:** MPTRt_7IFlezHaZXf\n\nThe playlist begins with \"As It Was\" by Harry Styles (2:46 duration) followed by another Harry Styles track (3:39 duration).\n\n**Note:** The tool output was truncated after showing only the first two tracks in the playlist. The complete playlist would contain more songs related to \"As It Was.\"\n\n## 5. Current Genius Artist Charts\n\nUnfortunately, the Genius - Song Lyrics: Chart: Artists tool returned an error (HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error). Therefore, we are unable to provide the current Genius artist charts for comparison with historical data.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis music industry analysis for 2022 reveals that Latin artists, particularly Bad Bunny, dominated YouTube viewership. K-pop groups like Blackpink and BTS also maintained strong positions. For viral video performance, Adele and Taylor Swift led with the fastest videos to reach 500 million views. While we obtained basic information about Halsey's \"Badlands (Deluxe Edition)\" album and partial playlist data for Harry Styles' \"As It Was,\" we were unable to retrieve the current Genius artist charts due to a technical error. The analysis demonstrates the continued global diversity in music consumption, with strong representation from Latin, K-pop, and mainstream pop artists.",

I've been revisiting some of Halsey's earlier work, particularly that 2015 expanded collection with the desert-themed title. Also, I clicked on a Harry Styles video with that catchy tune about change and time passing, but I'd like to see what else appears in that autoplay queue. And before I forget, I should check who's making waves on the lyric interpretation platform this week - their top 20 chart would be enlightening."

    "final_answer": "# Comprehensive Music Discovery Results\n\n## 1. Billboard Artist 100 Chart (January 15, 2023)\n\nThe Billboard tool provided the top artists from the Artist 100 chart for January 15, 2023:\n\n1. Taylor Swift (442 weeks on chart, peak position: #1)\n2. SZA (176 weeks on chart, peak position: #1)\n3. Morgan Wallen (201 weeks on chart, peak position: #1)\n4. The Weeknd (392 weeks on chart, peak position: #1)\n5. Drake (446 weeks on chart, peak position: #1)\n6. Harry Styles (185 weeks on chart, peak position: #1)\n7. Luke Combs (306 weeks on chart, peak position: #1)\n8. BTS (324 weeks on chart, peak position: #1) - marked with an award\n9. 21 Savage (124 weeks on chart, peak position: #3)\n10. Lil Baby (weeks on chart and peak position data was cut off in the tool output)\n\n**Note:** The output for the 10th artist (Lil Baby) was incomplete in the tool results.\n\n## 2. The Weeknd Radio Playlist\n\nThe Spotify radio playlist tool successfully generated a curated playlist based on The Weeknd's style:\n- Playlist URI: spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E4DTZUur7HqeC\n\n**Note:** While the tool returned a valid playlist URI, it didn't provide details about the actual songs or artists included in this playlist.\n\n## 3. Taylor Swift Artist Information\n\nThe Spotify artist information tool provided these details about Taylor Swift:\n\n- **Name:** Taylor Swift\n- **Spotify URI:** spotify:artist:06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02\n- **Followers:** 78,692,802\n- **Genres:** Pop\n- **Popularity:** 100/100 (maximum popularity score)\n- **Profile Images:** Available in three sizes (640x640, 320x320, 160x160)\n\n## 4. Canadian Radio Stations\n\nUnfortunately, there was an issue with the radio station search. The tool attempted to search for stations in Tibet (country_id: 39) instead of Canada, and returned no results. The tool output indicates:\n- Country searched: Tibet (ID: 39)\n- Total radios found: 0\n\n**Note:** This search failed to provide the requested Canadian radio stations due to an incorrect country ID parameter.\n\n## 5. Inspirational Music Quotes\n\nThe quotes tool returned 10 quotes, though most aren't specifically music-related. Here are a few that might be inspirational for playlist descriptions:\n\n- \"In art the best is good enough.\" - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n- \"There is nothing deep down inside us except what we have put there ourselves.\" - Richard Rorty\n- \"Science is built up of facts, as a house is with stones. But a collection of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house.\" - Henri Poincare\n\n**Note:** The quotes returned were general inspirational quotes rather than specifically music-related quotes, and the output was partially cut off after the 8th quote.\n\n## Summary\n\nYour music discovery session has yielded mixed results. You now have the top 10 Billboard artists from January 2023 (with Taylor Swift at #1), a curated radio playlist based on The Weeknd's style, and comprehensive information about Taylor Swift as an artist. However, the search for Canadian radio stations was unsuccessful due to an incorrect country parameter, and the quotes provided weren't specifically music-related. To complete your comprehensive music discovery session, you'll need to search again for Canadian radio stations and perhaps look for music-specific inspirational quotes.",

I also looked up detailed information about Taylor Swift on Spotify using her artist ID (06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02).

After seeing the rankings, I became interested in discovering music with a similar vibe to that Canadian artist known for 'Blinding Lights' and 'Starboy'. I'm also curious about the details behind that artist who sings 'Without Me' and has collaborated with BTS and Halsey. On another note, I've been thinking about traditional radio - what stations might I find if I were traveling across the northern part of North America, particularly in that large country above the US? And I'd love to read some thought-provoking quotes that radio hosts might share between songs."

Top YouTube Artists of 2022 (Including Featured Appearances)\n\nThe MusicData API successfully returned the top YouTube artists for 2022, ranked by views:\n\n1. Bad Bunny - 10,046,995,039 views\n2. Blackpink - 4,726,453,501 views\n3. BTS - 4,719,656,705 views\n4. Karol G - 4,164,397,009 views\n5. Anuel AA - 3,626,724,216 views\n6. Ozuna - 3,584,734,537 views\n7.

Rauw Alejandro - 3,194,700,937 views\n\n**Note:** The data includes 30 artists, but the tool output appears to be truncated after the 30th entry.\n\n## 3. Billboard Global Excl. US Chart (September 24, 2022)\n\nThe Billboard API successfully returned the Global Excl. US chart for September 24, 2022. Here are the top songs:\n\n1. \"Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 52\" by Bizarrap & Quevedo (maintained #1 from last week)\n2. \"I'm Good (Blue)\" by David Guetta & Bebe Rexha (maintained #2 from last week)\n3. \"Pink Venom\" by BLACKPINK (moved down from #1 last week)\n4. \"As It Was\" by Harry Styles (moved down from #1 last week)\n5. \"La Bachata\" by Manuel Turizo (maintained #5 from last week)\n\n**Note:** The tool output appears to be truncated, so the complete chart beyond these 5 entries is not available. Additionally, some data fields like weeks on chart appear to be empty.\n\n## 4. Radio Stations in Jakarta, Indonesia\n\nThe 50K Radio Stations API returned no results for radio stations in Jakarta, Indonesia. The API response indicated success but returned an empty data set, suggesting either there are no radio stations in the database for Jakarta, Indonesia, or there might be an issue with the search parameters.\n\n## 5. Music Videos from Genius\n\nThe Genius API returned an error indicating missing required parameters. Specifically, the API requires an \"artist_id\" parameter which was not provided in the request. Therefore, no music video data could be retrieved.\n\n## 6. Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' Track on SoundCloud\n\nThe SoundCloud Scraper tool returned an error message indicating that high-quality (HQ) audio is not available to BASIC users. The tool was unable to retrieve metadata or download links for Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' track due to subscription limitations.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis report successfully gathered partial data for the Billboard Catalog Albums chart, top YouTube artists of 2022, and the Billboard Global Excl. US chart for September 24, 2022. However, we encountered limitations with several data sources: no radio stations were found for Jakarta, Indonesia; the Genius API request failed due to missing parameters; and the SoundCloud metadata for Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' could not be retrieved due to subscription limitations. For a more comprehensive report, these issues would need to be addressed with proper API parameters or subscription upgrades.",

Additionally, I want to find radio stations in Jakarta, Indonesia (country ID 63), browse the first 15 music videos on Genius (though I realize I need to provide an artist ID), and get the metadata with a high-quality download link for Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' track on SoundCloud.",

Could you help me look up the Billboard Catalog Albums chart from September 24, 2022, and compare it with the Billboard Global Excl. US chart from that same date? I'm also curious about who dominated YouTube last year - specifically the top artists on the platform in 2022, including any featured collaborators. While we're exploring music platforms, I'd appreciate if you could find some radio stations in Jakarta, Indonesia, and pull up a few music videos on Genius. Finally, could you retrieve the metadata and a high-quality download link for Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' on SoundCloud? This would really help complete my research.",
    "hard_rewrite": "I've been reminiscing about music from a couple of years back. Remember that week in late September 2022 when The Weeknd's 'Starboy' was making waves on those specialized album charts that focus on older releases? I wonder how that compared to what was trending globally (outside the US) that same week. Also, I've been curious about which artists dominated YouTube that year - both main and featured collaborators. I'm planning a trip to Indonesia's capital soon and would love to tune into some local radio while there. Oh, and I've been exploring music platforms lately - what kind of content does Genius showcase? Finally, I've had Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' stuck in my head and would love to find the highest quality version on SoundCloud to really appreciate all the nuances."

    "final_answer": "# Music Exploration Information\n\n## 1. Random Radio Stations from Around the World\nUnfortunately, the Radio World tool returned an error (HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error) when attempting to retrieve random radio stations. I'm unable to provide the requested list of 15 random radio stations at this time.\n\n## 2. Top 10 Weekly Contributors on Genius\nThe Genius Leaderboard tool returned partial information about the top weekly contributors. Due to response truncation, I can only provide details about the top contributor:\n\n- **#1: resonare**\n  - Role: Editor\n  - IQ Points: 681,526\n  - Attribution Value: 39,233.8\n  - Profile: https://genius.com/resonare\n\nThe second contributor (Alexander) was partially visible with an attribution value of 28,063, but the data was cut off. Information about the remaining 8 contributors was not available in the response.\n\n## 3. Ennio Morricone's Work as a Composer\nThe MusiclinkssApi search returned several Ennio Morricone-related artist profiles on Spotify:\n\n- **Main Artist Profile**: Ennio Morricone (ID: 1nIUhcKHnK6iyumRyoV68C)\n  - URL: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1nIUhcKHnK6iyumRyoV68C\n  - Image: https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6761610000e5ebd0430d67cd189b4b54dcf6f9\n\n- **Additional Profiles**:\n  - Ennio Morricone (ID: 6GSJbZPnvTKjFb9smrirt6)\n  - Ennio Morricone Orchestra (ID: 7GyecEYqMtx9Wnauu6h6nI)\n  - Ennio Morricone, Edda e i Cantori Moderni di Alessandroni (ID: 34H52ZX9sOcdhedbQk5S8o)\n  - Orchestra di Ennio Morricone (ID: 0SalrsObsha3wJFZoABztI)\n  - Ennio Morricone e i Cantori Moderni di Alessandroni (ID: 1wa4Bnubvl05ch3X7UYg0O)\n  - Ennio Morricone (ID: 4bxLCrhyWoKTItGD8hsBdw)\n\nThe tool returned only basic profile information rather than detailed information about his compositions and work history.\n\n## 4. YouTube Music Profile for Spotify's Official Channel\nThe YouTube Music API returned information for a channel named \"4Tune \u2013 No Copyright Music\" instead of Spotify's official channel. This appears to be a mismatch between the requested channel and the returned data. The returned channel has playlists including:\n\n- Epic Music 2020 | Intense Cinematic Action (133K views)\n- Epic Suspense Music | Stealth Suspense Action Horror Soundtracks (75K views)\n- Comedy Music Instrumental | Playlist (37K views)\n\nThis does not match the requested Spotify official channel information.\n\n## 5. Hans Zimmer's Albums on Spotify\nThe MusiclinkssApi returned information about Hans Zimmer's albums on Spotify, though the response was truncated. The visible albums include:\n\n1. Chief of War (Apple TV+ Original Series Soundtrack) - Release date: 2025-08-01\n2. F1\u00ae The Movie (Original Score By Hans Zimmer) - Release date: 2025-07-11\n3. F1 The Album (Cinematic Edition) - Release date: 2025-06-26\n4. The Americas (Music from the Original Series) - Release date: 2025-03-21\n5. The World of Hans Zimmer - Part II: A New Dimension - Release date: 2025-01-31\n6. Dragon Age: The Veilguard (Original Soundtrack) - Release date: (truncated)\n\nNote that the future release dates suggest these may be placeholders or pre-releases.\n\n## 6. Latest Trending Tracks on Spotify\nThe Spotify Get Tracks tool returned information about only one track out of the three requested IDs:\n\n- **In Control (feat. Selin)** by Mahmut Orhan, Ali Arutan, and Selin\n  - Album: In Control (feat. Selin) (Single)\n  - Release Date: 2020-10-30\n\nThe response was truncated and did not provide information about the other requested tracks or trending tracks in general.\n\n## Summary\nI was able to provide partial information for most of your requests, but encountered several limitations: a server error for radio stations, truncated data for Genius contributors, basic profile information rather than detailed work for Ennio Morricone, mismatched YouTube channel information, partial album listings for Hans Zimmer with unusual future release dates, and limited track information instead of trending tracks. For a comprehensive music exploration session, you might need to try these requests individually or use different tools.",

BTS's 'Spring Day' from K-POP Database\nThe K-POP songs tool successfully retrieved information about BTS's 'Spring Day' along with three other songs with similar names by different artists. Here are the details for BTS's song:\n\n- **Artist**: BTS\n- **Song Name**: Spring Day\n- **Korean Name**: \ubd04\ub0a0\n- **Release Date**: February 13, 2017\n- **Director**: LUMPENS\n- **Video URL**: https://youtu.be/xEeFrLSkMm8\n- **Type**: Boy group\n- **Release Category**: Major\n\n## 2. Ludovico Einaudi's Playlists on SoundCloud\nThe SoundCloud Scraper tool found 2,709 playlists related to Ludovico Einaudi but only returned partial information about the first playlist. The data is incomplete as the tool output was cut off mid-response. From what was retrieved:\n\n- **Most Popular Playlist**: \"The Summer Portraits\" (appears to be an album)\n- **Created**: January 24, 2025 (note: this appears to be an error as it's a future date)\n- **Duration**: 1 hour 6 minutes 35 seconds\n- **Likes**: 312\n- **Reposts**: 14\n- **Track Count**: 13\n- **Artist Followers**: 2,063,385\n\n**Limitation**: The tool returned incomplete data, cutting off after listing only a few tracks, and we cannot see the remaining playlists that were found.\n\n## 3. Taylor Swift's 'Folklore' Album on Spotify\nThe Spotify Web tool returned partial information about Taylor Swift's 'Folklore' album:\n\n- **Album Name**: folklore (deluxe version)\n- **Release Date**: August 18, 2020\n- **Total Tracks**: 17\n- **First Track**: \"the 1\" (duration: 3:30)\n\n**Limitation**: The tool response was cut off, so we only received information about the album metadata and the beginning of the track listing, not the complete track list or other detailed information.\n\n## 4. The Weeknd Artist Information on Spotify\nThe Spotify Artists tool successfully retrieved complete information about The Weeknd:\n\n- **Name**: The Weeknd\n- **Followers**: 67,269,305\n- **Genres**: Canadian contemporary R&B, Canadian pop, pop\n- **Popularity**: 95 (out of 100)\n- **Profile Images**: Available in three resolutions (640x640, 320x320, 160x160)\n\n## 5. Adele's 'Hello' Shazam Count\nThe Shazam tool successfully retrieved the count for Adele's 'Hello':\n\n- **Shazam ID**: 40333609\n- **Total Shazams**: 3,933,741\n\n## 6. Billie Eilish's 'Happier Than Ever' Album\nThe Spotify_v3 API tool failed to retrieve information about Billie Eilish's album:\n\n- **Result**: The API returned a null value for the album\n- **Status**: Failed to retrieve album information\n\n## Summary\nFor your music comparison dashboard, I've gathered partial or complete information for 5 out of the 6 requested items. The data for Ludovico Einaudi's playlists and Taylor Swift's 'Folklore' album is incomplete due to truncated API responses. The request for Billie Eilish's 'Happier Than Ever' album failed completely. To build a comprehensive cross-platform music analysis project, you would need to make additional API calls to complete the missing information, particularly for the Billie Eilish album and to get the complete track listings for Taylor Swift's album and the full playlist information for Ludovico Einaudi.",

I also found limited information about one classical composer on SoundCloud (Heidi-Marie Arapa) for your classical stage comparison. \n\nHowever, several key pieces of information are missing: the Spanish chart rankings were unavailable due to subscription limitations, Ludovico Einaudi's SoundCloud presence couldn't be confirmed, and the US new releases information was incomplete. You may need to seek alternative sources for this missing information to complete your festival lineup planning.",

From what was visible:\n- There's a concert at RFK Stadium in Washington on July 15, 2023\n- Featured artists include Lil Uzi Vert, Jazmine Sullivan, and several others\n\nNote: The tool output was truncated, so there may be additional concert information that wasn't displayed.\n\n## 4) Local US Alternative Rock Radio Stations\n\nThe 50K Radio Stations tool returned no results for alternative rock stations in the US (country_id: 50):\n- The search returned 0 total stations\n- You may need to try different search parameters or another source for this information\n\n## 5) Music Trends Comparison (2019 vs Now)\n\nThe MusicData API provided YouTube's top music videos from the 21st week of 2019:\n\nTop videos from 2019 (Week 21):\n1. \"Daddy Yankee & Snow - Con Calma\" - 42,637,249 views\n2. \"ROSAL\u00cdA, J Balvin - Con Altura ft.

There are these two specific tracks I've been trying to find more information about - I have their Spotify IDs: 2x9cBmGzRBD0XpJHW8EKhk and 0tgVpDi06FyKpA1z0VMD4v. Lastly, I'm putting together a playlist and need some inspiration for songs that evoke beaches, sunshine, and vacation feelings."

And speaking of cultural diversity, I'm curious about which Vietnamese artists have managed to break through internationally with their visual content. For my evening relaxation routine, I'd like to discover some refined instrumental compositions from that platform where independent artists often share their work - perhaps about 50 pieces would give me enough variety. There's this band with a 'cold' name that I've been following for years - their unique identifier is 4gzpq5DPGxSnKTe4SA8HAU - I'd love to know more about their current standing in the industry. I'm also interested in seeing what the official curators at that major streaming service are recommending these days. As I'm planning a trip to Germany soon, I'd like to understand what music is resonating with listeners there currently. Oh, and my colleague mentioned they saved some important music industry data from last year in a file called 'MUSIC2023' - could you help me access that?"

For a current global music festival, you would need more up-to-date information. The research shows strong performances from artists like BTS, Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Harry Styles across different platforms during those time periods. Latin music appears particularly strong internationally. For radio station promotion options, unfortunately no data was available due to a technical error. For SoundCloud artists, the search returned limited results but identified at least one popular electronic music curator with a significant following.",

I'm curious about those iconic summer anthems that always bring back memories - particularly the top ones from Billboard's all-time rankings. There's also this user on Spotify called 'cruilla' whose taste I'd love to explore. My niece has been asking about those charming children's songs by that Norwegian author - Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner, I believe? I'm also researching which artists dominated YouTube last year, especially those who collaborated with others. There's this haunting Halsey track called 'Ashley' with lyrics I've been trying to remember. I stumbled across an interesting YouTube Music profile with the ID 'UC44hbeRoCZVVMVg5z0FfIww' that seems worth checking out. When I search for 'festival music' across platforms, what kind of results would I get? Oh, and there's this specific music file with path 'ABCDEF' that someone recommended - I wonder what it contains."

Billboard's Greatest Summer Songs of All Time\nThe Billboard tool returned an error: \"getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND billboard.cctuex9y9o7b.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com\". This indicates the Billboard database server was unreachable at the time of the request.\n\n## 3. New Music Releases in Canada\nThe Spotify New Releases tool also returned an error: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider\". No data about new Canadian music releases was obtained.\n\n## 4. Popular Mood Categories for Music on YouTube in German\nThe YouTube Music API successfully returned German mood categories for music classification. The data includes numerous genres such as:\n\n- Afro\n- Arabisch\n- Blues\n- Bollywood & Desi\n- Dance & Elektro\n- Folk & Akustik\n- Hip-Hop\n- Indie & Alternative\n- Jazz\n- K-Pop\n- Klassische Musik\n- Latin\n- Metal\n- Pop\n- R&B & Soul\n- Rock\n\nNote that the output appears to be truncated as it cuts off mid-response.\n\n## 5. Current Top Tracks on Shazam's Global Charts\nThe Shazam charts tool did not return any data. The output field is empty, suggesting an error or timeout occurred during the request.\n\n## 6. Song Lyrics for 'Bohemian Rhapsody'\nThe Genius lyrics search tool returned metadata about Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" including:\n- Artist: Queen\n- Release date: October 31, 1975\n- URL: https://genius.com/Queen-bohemian-rhapsody-lyrics\n\nHowever, the actual lyrics were not included in the response, and the output appears to be truncated.\n\n## 7. Radio Stations in Jakarta, Indonesia\nThe radio stations tool returned an empty dataset: `{'success': True, 'has_next': False, 'total': 0, 'data': []}`. This suggests that either there are no radio stations in the database for Jakarta, Indonesia, or there might be an issue with the search parameters.\n\n## 8. Details about Taylor Swift's 'Folklore' Album on Spotify\nThe Spotify Web tool successfully retrieved information about Taylor Swift's \"folklore (deluxe version)\" album:\n\n- Release date: August 18, 2020\n- Total tracks: 17\n- First track: \"the 1\" (duration: 3:30)\n\nThe response includes album artwork URLs, track listings with preview URLs, and other metadata, though the output appears to be truncated after the second track.\n\n## Summary\nYour global music discovery project has yielded mixed results. While we successfully gathered data about Vietnamese YouTube music videos, German music mood categories, and Taylor Swift's \"Folklore\" album, several tools encountered errors or returned incomplete data. The Billboard and Spotify New Releases APIs were unreachable, the Shazam charts returned no data, the Genius lyrics search provided metadata but not actual lyrics, and no radio stations were found for Jakarta. To complete your comprehensive analysis, you may need to retry these failed requests or explore alternative data sources.",

The search returned two results:\n\n1. **BTS - Dynamite**\n   - Release date: August 21, 2020\n   - English release\n   - Director: LUMPENS\n   - Video: https://youtu.be/gdZLi9oWNZg\n\n2. **VIXX - Dynamite**\n   - Release date: April 19, 2016\n   - Korean name: \ub2e4\uc774\ub108\ub9c8\uc774\ud2b8\n   - Director: VM Project\n   - Video: https://youtu.be/4bnIb1JJHdA\n\nNote that this search was limited to songs titled \"Dynamite\" and only returned 2 results, so it's not a comprehensive list of popular K-pop songs.\n\n## Billboard's Greatest Summer Hits\nUnfortunately, the Billboard tool returned an error: \"getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND billboard.cctuex9y9o7b.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com\". This means we couldn't retrieve Billboard's greatest summer hits of all time.\n\n## Top Vietnamese Music Videos on YouTube\nThe MusicData API successfully retrieved the top Vietnamese music videos on YouTube. The top 5 are:\n\n1. **365DABAND - B\u1ed0NG B\u1ed0NG BANG BANG | OFFICIAL MV**\n   - Views: 572,309,145\n   - Yesterday's views: 77,951\n   - Link: https://youtube.com/watch?v=BwN3NiZt-PU\n\n2. **B\u1ed1ng B\u1ed1ng Bang Bang - B\u00e9 B\u00e0o Ng\u01b0**\n   - Views: 548,818,757\n   - Yesterday's views: 201,475\n   - Link: https://youtube.com/watch?v=GhZML0HSli8\n\n3. **Th\u01b0\u01a1ng L\u1eafm Th\u1ea7y C\u00f4 \u01a0i! - B\u00e9 Phan Hi\u1ebfu Ki\u00ean**\n   - Views: 483,898,676\n   - Yesterday's views: 41,652\n   - Link: https://youtube.com/watch?v=pLHSPrJUx4s\n\n4. **X\u00daC X\u1eaeC X\u00daC X\u1eba - B\u00c9 B\u1ea2O AN ft PHI LONG**\n   - Views: 427,688,391\n   - Yesterday's views: 7,897\n   - Link: https://youtube.com/watch?v=LjuNB23gTiU\n\n5. **S\u00d3NG GI\u00d3 | K-ICM x JACK**\n   - Views: 424,762,083\n   - Yesterday's views: 58,402\n   - Link: https://youtube.com/watch?v=j8U06veqxdU\n\nNote: The tool returned 12 results but the output was truncated, so we don't have the complete list.\n\n## Most Viewed YouTube Videos from 2022\nThe MusicData API successfully retrieved the most viewed YouTube videos from 2022.

Here are some options:\n\n1. **R\u00e1di\u00f3 1** (Hungary)\n   - Genre: Community\n   - URL: http://icast.connectmedia.hu/5212/live.mp3\n\n2. **Soft Radio** (Uganda)\n   - Genre: African\n   - URL: http://stream.zeno.fm/8ybc1t1m8yzuv\n\n3. **Klassik Radio - Opera** (Germany)\n   - Genre: Classical\n   - URL: http://stream.klassikradio.de/opera/mp3-192/\n\n4. **ArenaRadio-Dance** (United Kingdom)\n   - Genre: Dance\n   - URL: http://stream.zeno.fm/ruvek6z3kg8uv\n\nNote: The tool returned more stations but the output was truncated.\n\n### Continuous Music Mix\nThe Emisora Radio Dosis tool was called to provide a continuous music mix, but it returned binary data which cannot be displayed in text format. This appears to be streaming audio data that would need to be played through an audio player.\n\n## Summary\nI've gathered information on popular K-pop songs (specifically \"Dynamite\" by BTS and VIXX), top Vietnamese music videos, and the most viewed YouTube videos from 2022. I've also found several radio stations from different countries and genres that you can listen to while working. Unfortunately, some tools returned errors or incomplete data, so I couldn't provide information about Billboard's greatest summer hits, BTS tracks on Spotify, or current global music chart trends. The continuous music mix from Radio Dosis returned binary data that would need to be played through an audio player.",

As part of my research on global trends, I want to check out which music videos by Vietnamese artists have the highest views on YouTube, and while we're on YouTube, what were the most viewed videos overall from 2022? For streaming platforms, I need to search for BTS tracks on Spotify, but let's cap it at 10 results. To understand what's currently popular, could you show me the top 10 tracks from Shazam charts, specifically in English? Lastly, I'm putting together a homepage featuring radio options - could you recommend 8 radio stations for this and provide some details about the Radio Dosis Mix streaming service?",

While researching regional influences, I wonder which Vietnamese artists have achieved the greatest YouTube success? Speaking of YouTube, what were the standout videos that captured global attention in 2022? For my section on global fandoms, I need to examine BTS's presence on streaming platforms like Spotify - just their most representative tracks would suffice. I'm also tracking how English-language songs perform on music identification services like Shazam. Finally, for the radio section of my project, what would be a representative sample of stations to feature, and could you tell me more about this 'Radio Dosis Mix' service I've heard mentioned?"

    "final_answer": "# Comprehensive Music Dashboard for March 2020\n\n## 1. Billboard Artist 100 Chart (March 18, 2020)\n\nThe Billboard Artist 100 chart from March 18, 2020 shows the following top artists:\n\n1. Lil Uzi Vert (up from #28 last week, 125 weeks on chart)\n2. NCT 127 (new entry, 9 weeks on chart)\n3. Jhene Aiko (up from #67 last week, 16 weeks on chart)\n4. BTS (down from #3 last week, 179 weeks on chart)\n5.

Billie Eilish (down from #6 last week, 81 weeks on chart)\n9. The Weeknd (up from #10 last week, 244 weeks on chart)\n10. Roddy Ricch (down from #8 last week)\n\n*Note: The tool output was cut off after the 10th entry, so the complete chart data is not available.*\n\n## 2. Billboard Global 200 Chart (September 19, 2020)\n\nThe Billboard Global 200 chart from September 19, 2020 (earliest available date, which is after March 2020) shows:\n\n1. \"WAP\" by Cardi B Featuring Megan Thee Stallion (new entry)\n2. \"Dynamite\" by BTS (new entry)\n3. \"Mood\" by 24kGoldn Featuring iann dior (new entry)\n4. \"Hawai\" by Maluma (new entry)\n5. \"Laugh Now Cry Later\" by Drake Featuring Lil Durk (new entry)\n6. \"Savage Love (Laxed - Siren Beat)\" by Jawsh 685 x Jason Derulo (new entry)\n7. \"Blinding Lights\" by The Weeknd (new entry)\n8. \"Ice Cream\" by BLACKPINK X Selena Gomez (new entry)\n\n*Note: This chart began on September 19, 2020, which is 6 months after the requested March 2020 timeframe. The tool output was also cut off after the 8th entry.*\n\n## 3. Top Music Videos on Genius\n\nThe tool returned an error indicating missing required parameters. Specifically, it requires an artist_id parameter that was not provided. Therefore, no data is available for top music videos on Genius from March 2020.\n\n## 4. Details about Post Malone's 'Circles'\n\nThe tool returned information about \"River Flows In You\" by Yiruma instead of Post Malone's \"Circles\". This appears to be an incorrect key value in the request. Therefore, no data is available for Post Malone's \"Circles\".\n\n## 5. Current Genius Leaderboard\n\nThe current Genius leaderboard shows top contributors:\n\n1. resonare (Editor) - 7,625.4 attribution value, 681,526 IQ\n2. [Second user data was cut off in the tool output]\n\n*Note: The tool output was cut off after the first complete entry, so the full leaderboard is not available.*\n\n## 6. Radio Playlist Based on The Weeknd\n\nThe Spotify tool successfully generated a radio playlist based on The Weeknd:\n- Playlist URI: spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E4DTZUur7HqeC\n\n## 7. YouTube Music Search for 'Pandemic Songs'\n\nThe YouTube Music API tool returned a 500 Internal Server Error, indicating the server was overloaded or encountered an application error. Therefore, no search results for \"pandemic songs\" are available.\n\n## 8. Apple Music Album Details for Dua Lipa's 'Future Nostalgia'\n\nThe Apple Music tool did not return any data for Dua Lipa's \"Future Nostalgia\" album. The output was empty, suggesting either an error occurred or the album information could not be retrieved.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis dashboard provides a partial view of the music landscape around March 2020. We have complete data for the Billboard Artist 100 chart showing Lil Uzi Vert at #1, with Post Malone at #5 and The Weeknd at #9. The Global 200 chart data is from September 2020 (not March), showing \"WAP\" by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion at #1, with The Weeknd's \"Blinding Lights\" still charting at #7 months after its release. A Spotify radio playlist based on The Weeknd was successfully created. Unfortunately, several tools returned errors or incomplete data, limiting our ability to provide a truly comprehensive dashboard for the requested time period.",

Then find some music videos related to the pandemic by searching for 'pandemic songs' on YouTube Music. I'd also like to see Dua Lipa's 'Future Nostalgia' album details on Apple Music, as it was a popular quarantine album. Additionally, show me today's trending artists on Genius Leaderboard, get details for the Shazam song with key 40333609, and generate a radio playlist based on The Weeknd (Spotify URI: spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ) who was popular during this time.",

Since Dua Lipa's 'Future Nostalgia' was such a quarantine hit, I'd like to see its details on Apple Music. While we're exploring music trends, could you also display today's trending artists on the Genius Leaderboard? I'm curious about a specific song with Shazam key 40333609 - can you look up what that is? Finally, The Weeknd was huge during lockdown, so could you create a radio playlist based on him using his Spotify URI: spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ?",

And I'm curious about that new global chart Billboard launched later that year - what did the inaugural one look like in September? I remember so many musicians creating content about isolation - could you find some of those themed tracks? Also, Dua Lipa released this album that became everyone's quarantine soundtrack with all those retro dance vibes - what was on that record again? I'm also wondering which artists are capturing attention today on Genius. Oh, and there's this beautiful piano piece I heard during lockdown with key 40333609 on Shazam - what is it? Finally, since The Weeknd was such a defining voice of that period, could you create a radio experience based on his artistic style?"

    "final_answer": "# Comprehensive Music Discovery Platform Content\n\n## 1. Artist Spotlight: Halsey\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool provided a random song from Halsey's discography:\n\n**Song:** \"More\"\n**Album:** Manic\n**Release Date:** January 17, 2020\n\nThe tool returned a substantial portion of the song's lyrics, which include emotional themes about longing and loss. The lyrics include verses like \"They told me once, nothing grows when a house ain't a home\" and \"I sit and I stare at your clothes in the drawer, I cry and my knuckles get sore.\"\n\n## 2. International Trends: South Korea\nThe YouTube trending videos tool for South Korea was called but did not return any data. This section of your platform would need alternative data sources to populate content for trending music videos in South Korea.\n\n## 3. Global Radio Feature\nThe Radio World tool returned an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to retrieve random worldwide radio stations. This feature cannot be populated with the current tool response and would require a retry or alternative data source.\n\n## 4. Daily Hits: Most Viewed English-Language Music Videos\nThe MusicData API successfully returned the top English-language music videos in the last 24 hours:\n\n1. Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars - \"Die With A Smile\" (2,735,727 views)\n2. Linkin Park - \"The Emptiness Machine\" (1,467,101 views)\n3. Crazy Frog - \"Axel F\" (1,466,272 views)\n4. Sabrina Carpenter - \"Taste\" (1,254,276 views)\n5. Sabrina Carpenter - \"Espresso\" (1,180,691 views)\n6. The Weeknd - \"Save Your Tears\" (1,131,318 views)\n7. Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth - \"See You Again\" (1,079,561 views)\n8. Linkin Park - \"Numb\" (1,051,090 views)\n9. Megan Thee Stallion feat. RM - \"Neva Play\" (956,931 views)\n10. *NSYNC - \"Bye Bye Bye\" (948,483 views)\n\nNote: The output appears to have been truncated after the 10th entry, so there may be additional videos in the complete dataset.\n\n## 5. Artist Catalog: The Weeknd\nThe Spotify Artist Albums tool encountered an error when attempting to retrieve The Weeknd's discography. The response returned HTML content indicating an access issue rather than album data. This section would need an alternative data source or troubleshooting of the API connection.\n\n## 6. Related Artists: Dua Lipa\nThe MusiclinkssApi successfully returned search results for \"Dua Lipa\":\n\n* Dua Lipa (primary artist)\n* Dua Empat\n* SZA (related artist)\n* Dua Lipapa\n* Tate McRae (related artist)\n* The Dua Lipa Cover Band\n* Ariana Grande (related artist)\n* LIPA DUA\n* Doja Cat (partial entry)\n\nNote: The output appears to have been truncated, potentially missing additional related artists.\n\n## 7. Live Radio: Radio Dosis\nThe Emisora Radio Dosis tool was called but did not return any visible output. This suggests either an empty response or a streaming URL that wasn't captured in the text output. This section would need further investigation to ensure proper functionality.\n\n## 8. Similar Songs: Billie Eilish's \"bad guy\"\nThe YouTube Music API successfully returned a watch playlist based on Billie Eilish's \"bad guy\":\n\n1. Billie Eilish - \"bad guy\" (3:26, 18M views)\n2. Billie Eilish - [Untitled track] (3:51)\n\nNote: The output appears to have been truncated, likely containing more recommended tracks in the complete response.\n\n## 9. Popular Searches: BTS Dynamite\nThe Shazam search tool returned information about BTS's \"Dynamite\":\n\n**Title:** Dynamite\n**Artist:** BTS\n**Key:** 533935352\n**Album Cover:** Available (URL provided)\n\nThe response includes sharing links and image resources that could be used in your platform's interface.\n\nIn summary, several components of your music discovery platform have successfully retrieved data, while others encountered errors or returned incomplete information. You'll need to address the issues with the South Korean trends, global radio stations, and The Weeknd's discography sections to ensure a complete user experience.",

Spotify's Global Weekly Top Tracks\n\n**Error**: The Spotify Scraper tool returned an error message indicating that this endpoint is not available to BASIC users and requires a higher subscription plan. Therefore, no data on Spotify's current global weekly top tracks could be retrieved.\n\n## 3. YouTube Music's Trending Artists in Germany\n\nTop trending artists in Germany according to YouTube Music:\n\n1. AYLIVA (782K subscribers)\n2. Linkin Park (23.8M subscribers)\n3. Apache 207 (1.51M subscribers, trending up)\n4. Bonez MC (246K subscribers)\n5. [Data truncated - additional artists not shown in the tool output]\n\n**Note**: The data appears to be truncated, showing only the first 5 trending artists out of what is likely a longer list.\n\n## 4. Most Viewed YouTube Music Videos Published in 2020\n\nThe most viewed YouTube music videos published in 2020 are:\n\n1. Future - Life Is Good (Official Music Video) ft. Drake (2.19B views, 172K daily views)\n2. BTS (\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8) 'Dynamite' Official MV (1.89B views, 1.33M daily views)\n3.

Badshah \u2013 Genda Phool | Jacqueline Fernandez [data truncated]\n\n**Note**: The data appears to be truncated after the 11th entry.\n\n## 5. Halsey Artist Spotlight\n\n### Random Halsey Song with Lyrics\n\nThe random Halsey song selected is \"More\" from the album \"Manic\" (released January 17, 2020). Excerpt of lyrics:\n\n\"They told me once, nothing grows\nWhen a house ain't a home\nIs it true, honestly\"\n\n\"Lyin' awake, and I stare at the door\nI just can't take it no more\"\n\n\"And when you decide it's your time to arrive\nI've loved you for all of my life\"\n\n## 6. Halsey's 'Manic' Album Information\n\nAlbum details:\n- Name: Manic\n- Release Date: January 17, 2020\n- Artist: Halsey\n- Contains 15 songs (IDs provided but not the actual song titles)\n\n## 7. Halsey's Discography\n\nThe tool returned a partial list of Halsey's songs including:\n- \"Is There Somewhere\"\n- \"Trouble (stripped)\"\n- \"Empty Gold\"\n\n**Note**: The data appears to be significantly truncated, showing only the beginning of what would be Halsey's full discography.\n\n## 8. Related Songs to Taylor Swift's 'Cruel Summer'\n\nThe tool returned related content, but it appears to be for a different song than requested. The data shows songs related to what seems to be a Sido track rather than Taylor Swift's \"Cruel Summer\". The related songs include:\n\n1. Sido - \"Masafaka\"\n2. Eko Fresh - \"Gheddo Reloaded (feat. Sido)\"\n3. Sido - \"Endstation (Live)\"\n\n**Note**: There appears to be an issue with the browse_id parameter used, as it returned German rap content unrelated to Taylor Swift.\n\n## 9. YouTube Music's Autoplay Playlist for Billie Eilish's 'bad guy'\n\nThe autoplay playlist starting with Billie Eilish's \"bad guy\" includes:\n\n1. Billie Eilish - \"bad guy\" (3:26, 18M views)\n2. Billie Eilish - \"BIRDS OF A FEATHER\" (3:51, 4.2M views)\n3. ROS\u00c9 & Bruno Mars - [Title not fully shown] (2:54)\n\n**Note**: The data appears to be truncated after the third track in the autoplay playlist.\n\n## Cross-Platform Trends Analysis\n\nBased on the limited data available:\n\n1. **Artist Consistency**: Artists like Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, and BLACKPINK show strong presence across multiple platforms.\n\n2. **Regional Differences**: German YouTube trends (featuring artists like AYLIVA and Apache 207) differ significantly from global charts.\n\n3. **Longevity of Hits**: Taylor Swift's \"Cruel Summer\" shows remarkable staying power (28 weeks on Billboard Global 200) despite being released years earlier.\n\n4. **2020 Content Relevance**: Music videos from 2020 continue to accumulate significant views, with BTS's \"Dynamite\" still gaining over 1.3M daily views.\n\n**Limitations**: This analysis is constrained by incomplete data from several tools, particularly the Spotify data (which returned an error), truncated responses, and the incorrect related songs for Taylor Swift's track.",

You obtained complete data for Halsey's random song, YouTube Music mood categories, and Spotify user 'cruilla' playlists (which showed zero public playlists). However, you encountered errors with Genius and SoundCloud requests, and received incomplete data for Ed Sheeran's discography, Radio World's country list, and Taylor Swift's album catalog. To build a comprehensive platform, you'll need to address these limitations by upgrading subscription plans for SoundCloud access, implementing pagination for the truncated results, and resolving the Genius API error.",

And speaking of that British singer's work, I've always found his song about preserving memories particularly moving - is there a way to get more details about it on SoundCloud? On another note, I'm trying to organize my music by mood - what categories does YouTube Music use for this in English? I heard someone mention a Spotify user called 'cruilla' who has great taste - can we see what playlists they've made public? For a project I'm working on, I need comprehensive information about countries with radio stations - ideally a large list (around 500) starting from the beginning, alphabetically. Also, I've been trying to find more information about that haunting track by the young artist with the neon green hair roots - her breakthrough hit about a 'bad guy' on SoundCloud. Finally, could we look at the complete album collection of that award-winning female artist (ID: 06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02) who's known for her narrative songwriting?"

Speaking of which, that explosive English-language hit they released a few years ago really changed their trajectory - I wonder what their full catalog looks like on streaming platforms. I'm also planning a trip to a Pacific island nation - country code 111 - and want to know what radio stations I might tune into there. What kinds of music genres are even available on radio platforms generally? Lastly, I'm trying to compare the online presence of that four-member female K-pop powerhouse group with America's blonde pop songwriter queen who recently broke streaming records."

    "final_answer": "# Music Festival Content Planning Results\n\nI've attempted to gather the diverse content you requested for your music festival, but encountered several limitations with the tools. Here's what I was able to compile:\n\n## 1) Top 10 Greatest Summer Songs (Billboard)\n**Tool Contribution: Billboard_v2: Greatest of All Time Songs of the Summer**\n\nUnfortunately, this tool returned an error (SequelizeHostNotFoundError). The database server could not be reached, so I couldn't retrieve the top 10 greatest summer songs according to Billboard.\n\n## 2) Popular Afrobeats Songs from June 2023\n**Tool Contribution: Billboard API_v2: Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs**\n\nThe API was unreachable when attempting to get Afrobeats songs from June 2023. The tool reported that while the client and gateway were working, the API itself was not functioning.\n\n## 3) Disney Children's Songs\n**Tool Contribution: kjoller: Get songs by composer**\n\nThe tool returned an empty data set when searching for Disney as a composer. While the status was \"OK,\" no actual songs were returned in the results.\n\n## 4) Radio Station Genres\n**Tool Contribution: 50K Radio Stations: Get Genres**\n\nThe tool successfully returned genre information, but with limited results:\n- Only 1 genre was returned: \"Music\" (ID: 62)\n- This is likely a very broad category and doesn't provide the specific genre breakdown needed for a diverse streaming booth.\n\n## 5) Beyonc\u00e9's 'Renaissance' Album\n**Tool Contribution: Apple Music: Album**\n\nThe tool was called but no output was returned for Beyonc\u00e9's 'Renaissance' album. This appears to be a technical issue with the tool execution.\n\n## 6) Taylor Swift Radio Playlist\n**Tool Contribution: Spotify_v3: Get radio playlist**\n\nThe tool successfully returned a radio playlist based on Taylor Swift:\n- Playlist URI: spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E4AfEUiirXPyP\n- This can be used for your continuous music stream, though the actual songs in the playlist weren't provided in the output.\n\n## 7) Dua Lipa's 'Dance The Night' Song Details\n**Tool Contribution: Youtube Music API (Detailed): Get Song**\n\nThe tool returned an error requiring sign-in authentication. The message indicated \"Sign in to confirm you're not a bot\" and no song details were provided.\n\n## 8) The Weeknd's Albums\n**Tool Contribution: MusiclinkssApi: Get artist's albums**\n\nSuccessfully retrieved a partial list of The Weeknd's albums:\n1. Starboy (Deluxe) - Released: 2023-03-14\n2. Live At SoFi Stadium - Released: 2023-03-03\n3. Avatar: The Way of Water (Soundtrack) - Released: 2022-12-15\n4. Dawn FM (Alternate World) - Released: 2022-01-07\n5. Dawn FM - Released: 2022-01-06\n6. After Hours (Deluxe) - Released: 2020-03-20\n7. After Hours - Released: 2020-03-20\n8. My Dear Melancholy, - Released: 2018-03-30\n9. Starboy - Released: 2018-03-30\n\nNote: The output appears to be truncated, so this may not be a complete list of all The Weeknd's albums.\n\n## 9) 'Blinding Lights' Song Details\n**Tool Contribution: Shazam: songs/get-details**\n\nThe tool returned partial information, but not for \"Blinding Lights.\" Instead, it returned details for a song called \"Ale jazz!\" by sanah & Vito Bambino. The output was also truncated. This appears to be an error with the song key provided.\n\n## 10) Bruno Mars' 'An Evening With Silk Sonic' Album\n**Tool Contribution: Apple Music: Album**\n\nThe tool was called but no output was returned for Bruno Mars' album. This appears to be a technical issue with the tool execution.\n\n## Summary\n\nUnfortunately, most of the tools encountered errors or returned incomplete information. The only fully successful results were the Taylor Swift radio playlist URI and a partial list of The Weeknd's albums. For a comprehensive music festival planning, you would need to try alternative sources or tools to gather the missing information.",

My kids are going through a major Disney phase - are there any child-friendly songs in that universe I could play for them? I'm also considering getting into internet radio but have no idea what genres are even available these days. On another note, I've heard Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance album is quite the artistic statement and would love to see what tracks are included. For my workout playlist, I'm a huge Taylor Swift fan (that artist with the Spotify URI 06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02) and need some similar music to keep me motivated. There's also this music video I found with ID 8kYkciD9VjU that I can't seem to identify. Oh, and I've recently discovered The Weeknd's music through that Spotify page (https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ) and wonder what albums he's released. There's also this catchy song with Shazam key 552406075 that I'd love to know more about.

    "final_answer": "# Global Music Discovery Platform Data Analysis\n\nI've gathered information from various music sources to help with your global music discovery platform. Here's what I found from each source:\n\n## 1. Radio Stations in Jakarta, Indonesia\n\nThe 50K Radio Stations tool returned no results when searching for Jakarta, Indonesia. The output shows:\n```\n{'success': True, 'has_next': False, 'total': 0, 'data': []}\n```\nThis indicates that either there are no radio stations indexed for Jakarta in this particular database, or there might be an issue with the search parameters.\n\n## 2. Ludovico Einaudi's Albums on SoundCloud\n\nThe SoundCloud Scraper successfully found Ludovico Einaudi's albums with 193 total results. Here's information about his most recent album:\n\n- **Album Title**: The Summer Portraits\n- **Release Date**: January 31, 2025 (Note: This appears to be a future date, which may indicate incorrect metadata)\n- **Duration**: 1 hour 6 minutes 35 seconds\n- **Track Count**: 13 tracks\n- **Genre**: Classical Crossover\n- **Likes**: 312\n- **Reposts**: 14\n\nThe artist profile shows Ludovico Einaudi has over 2 million followers (2,063,385) and is verified on the platform.\n\nNote that the tool output was cut off, so we only received partial information about the album tracks.\n\n## 3. Billie Eilish's \"Bad Guy\" on YouTube Music\n\nThe YouTube Music API returned information about Billie Eilish's \"Bad Guy\":\n\n- **Title**: bad guy\n- **Artist**: Billie Eilish\n- **Duration**: 3:26 (206 seconds)\n- **Video Type**: Official Music Video (OMV)\n- **Views**: 1.3 billion\n- **Video ID**: DyDfgMOUjCI\n\nThe search also returned related content, including a remix with Justin Bieber and live performances, though some of this information was cut off in the response.\n\n## 4. Popular Spanish-Language Songs in Spain\n\nThe Billboard-API for Spain Songs returned an error message indicating that this endpoint is only available on the Ultra plan and above. We couldn't retrieve the current popular Spanish songs in Spain due to this access limitation.\n\n## 5. Lyrics for Yiruma's \"Kiss the Rain\"\n\nThe Genius API search found Yiruma's \"Kiss the Rain\" with the following details:\n- **Release Date**: October 23, 2003\n- **Type**: Instrumental (no lyrics)\n- **Lyrics State**: Complete (though being instrumental, it doesn't contain traditional lyrics)\n\nThe tool response was cut off before providing the actual lyrics content, but it's worth noting that this is primarily an instrumental piece.\n\n## 6. Taylor Swift's Albums on Spotify\n\nThe Spotify API successfully returned Taylor Swift's albums, though the response was cut off after showing partial information about one album. We can see that:\n- **Artist ID**: 06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02\n- Her music is available in numerous markets worldwide\n\nThe response was truncated before showing the complete album list or detailed album information.\n\n## 7. Extended Versions of Meditation Music\n\nThe attempt to use the Miza tool for extending meditation music returned an error:\n```\n{'message': \"Endpoint '/ytdlp' does not exist\"}\n```\nThis indicates that the specific endpoint for trimming/extending songs is not available or has been deprecated.\n\n## 8. Countries with Available Radio Stations\n\nThe Radio World tool successfully returned a list of countries with radio stations. The database contains 219 total countries, and the response included the first 100 countries (alphabetically). Each country entry includes:\n- Country ID\n- Country name\n- Country flag URL\n- Total number of radio stations available\n\nFor example:\n- Afghanistan: 10 radio stations\n- Albania: 54 radio stations\n- Algeria: 77 radio stations\n\nThe response was cut off before showing the complete list of countries.\n\n## 9. Classical Piano Compositions by Chopin\n\nThe YouTube Music API returned an error when attempting to get information about a specific Chopin composition (video ID: 9E6b3swbnWg). The error message indicates that authentication is required:\n```\n'status': 'LOGIN_REQUIRED', 'reason': 'Sign in to confirm you're not a bot'\n```\n\n## 10. Trending K-pop Songs\n\nThe Shazam search for \"BTS Dynamite\" returned information about this popular K-pop song:\n- **Title**: Dynamite\n- **Artist**: BTS\n- **Available on**: Apple Music, Spotify\n- **Preview URL**: Available through Apple Music\n\nThe response includes links to album artwork, sharing options, and music streaming services, though it was cut off before showing complete details.\n\n## Summary\n\nYour global music discovery platform can integrate data from multiple sources, but there are some limitations to consider:\n\n1. Some APIs require authentication or premium subscriptions (Billboard)\n2. Several responses were truncated, indicating potential size limitations\n3. Some tools returned errors or no results (Jakarta radio stations, meditation music extension)\n4.

I'd also love to see information about Yiruma's 'Kiss the Rain' on Genius with 5 results, and I want to browse Taylor Swift's albums on Spotify using her artist ID. There's this YouTube video I've been enjoying (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCOF9LN_Zxs) - could you use Miza's trimming tool to create an MP3 version that ends at 45 minutes without changing the start time? For another project, I need a comprehensive list of 100 countries in ascending order from Radio World's database.

I also enjoy classical piano compositions - what albums might I find from that Italian composer known for minimalist piano pieces? I'm also trying to find that popular song by the young American artist with green hair - the one with the dark, edgy vibe that was a massive hit. What were people listening to in Spain during spring of 2023? I'm looking for that emotional piano piece by the Korean composer - the one that sounds like rainfall. I'm also interested in seeing what discography is available from that female artist known for frequently re-recording her albums. I found this relaxing YouTube video that's quite long - is there a way to save just the first 45 minutes as an audio file? I'm compiling a comprehensive list of countries for a music streaming project - could I get that in alphabetical order? I tried accessing details about a specific YouTube Music video but encountered an issue.

    "final_answer": "# Summer Music Festival Planning Research Results\n\n## 1. Billboard's Greatest Summer Songs of All Time\nThe Billboard tool returned an error when attempting to retrieve the Greatest of All Time Songs of the Summer chart. The specific error was a host connection issue (\"getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND\"), indicating the Billboard database server was unreachable at the time of the request.\n\n## 2. Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' Track Details from SoundCloud\nThe SoundCloud scraper tool was unable to provide the requested high-quality audio information for Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph'. The tool returned an error message stating that \"HQ audio is not available to BASIC users\" and suggested subscribing to a higher plan to access this feature.\n\n## 3. Summer-Themed Playlists on YouTube Music\nThe YouTube Music API successfully returned search results for \"summer playlist\". Key findings include:\n\n- **Top Result**: An artist profile named \"Summer Playlist\" with 182 subscribers\n- **Featured Playlists**: \n  - \"All-Time Summer Jams\" by YouTube Music (125 tracks)\n\nNote: The tool output was truncated, so there may be additional playlists that weren't visible in the results.\n\n## 4. Halsey's 'Manic' Album Details\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool successfully retrieved information about the \"Manic\" album:\n\n- **Album Name**: Manic\n- **Release Date**: January 17, 2020\n- **Artist**: Halsey\n- **Track Count**: 15 songs (IDs were provided but not the actual song titles)\n\n## 5. Popular Radio Stations for Promotion Partnerships\nThe Radio World tool returned a list of featured radio stations that could be potential promotion partners. The results included:\n\n- R\u00e1dio 104 FM Bezerros (Brazil)\n- Radio Atl\u00e1ntida (Bolivia)\n- R\u00e1di\u00f3 1 (Hungary)\n- GotRadio - Piano Perfect (USA)\n- Gartenwelt Frey (Germany)\n- R\u00e1dio Mil Gl\u00f3rias (country not visible in truncated output)\n\nNote: The output was truncated, so only 6 out of the 15 requested stations were visible in the results.\n\n## 6. Trending Music Albums on Genius Charts\nThe Genius - Song Lyrics: Chart: Albums tool returned an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error. No information about trending albums was retrieved.\n\n## 7. Similar Tracks to Dua Lipa's 'Levitating'\nThe YouTube Music API successfully retrieved a watch playlist for Dua Lipa's \"Levitating\". Similar tracks included:\n\n1. \"Levitating (feat. DaBaby)\" by Dua Lipa - 3:51, 8.3M views\n2. \"No Lie (feat. Dua Lipa)\" by Sean Paul - 3:49, 8.2M views\n\nNote: The output was truncated, so there are likely more similar tracks that weren't visible in the results.\n\n## 8. Cities with Active Radio Stations in the US\nThe 50K Radio Stations tool was queried for cities with radio stations in the US (country_id: 223), but returned an empty dataset with \"total: 0\". This suggests either an issue with the API or incorrect parameters.\n\n## 9. The Weeknd as a Potential Headliner\nThe YouTube Music API returned partial information about The Weeknd, including some of his albums:\n\n- \"Hurry Up Tomorrow\"\n- \"The Highlights (Deluxe)\"\n- \"Dawn FM\"\n\nNote: The output was truncated, so complete artist information wasn't available in the results.\n\n## 10. Taylor Swift's 'Cruel Summer' Track Information\nThe Spotify tool successfully retrieved detailed information about Taylor Swift's \"Cruel Summer\":\n\n- **Track Name**: Cruel Summer\n- **Album**: Lover (released August 23, 2019)\n- **Duration**: 2:58 (178,426 ms)\n- **Popularity**: 89/100\n- **Explicit**: No\n- **ISRC**: USUG11901472\n\n## Summary\nYour summer music festival planning research yielded mixed results. While you obtained useful information about Halsey's \"Manic\" album, Taylor Swift's \"Cruel Summer\", and some summer-themed playlists on YouTube Music, several tools returned errors or incomplete data. For comprehensive festival planning, you'll need to pursue alternative sources for Billboard's summer songs list, Ed Sheeran's track details, trending albums, and US radio station information. The partial information about The Weeknd and the limited radio station data will require additional research for effective promotion partnerships.",

Speaking of artists, what's the story behind Halsey's 'Manic' collection? For my road trip, I should probably bookmark some radio stations - maybe 15 good options would be enough. What albums are people listening to this month? There's this great music video with DaBaby and Dua Lipa I want to find similar tracks to. I'm also planning my route through the US and wondering which cities have good radio coverage. The Weeknd seems to be everywhere lately - what's his full catalog like?

The Spotify Scraper tool returned an error indicating that this endpoint is not available to users on the BASIC plan and requires a subscription to a higher plan. Without access to this data, I cannot provide the current global Spotify top tracks for your report.\n\n## 2. YouTube's Top Artists from 2022\n\nThe MusicData API successfully provided YouTube's top artists from 2022 based on view counts. Here are the results:\n\n| Ranking | Artist | Views |\n|---------|--------|-------|\n| 1 | Bad Bunny | 7,321,534,148 |\n| 2 | Blackpink | 4,618,844,818 |\n| 3 | BTS | 3,933,034,042 |\n| 4 | Karol G | 2,932,040,282 |\n| 5 | Shakira | 2,698,413,976 |\n| 6 | The Weeknd | 2,579,173,236 |\n| 7 | Henrique e Juliano | 2,468,399,378 |\n| 8 | Sidhu Moose Wala | 2,439,164,311 |\n| 9 | Gusttavo Lima | 2,361,844,231 |\n| 10 | Mar\u00edlia Mendon\u00e7a | 2,316,860,838 |\n| 11 | Daddy Yankee | 2,195,033,513 |\n| 12 | Anuel AA | 2,083,208,115 |\n| 13 | YoungBoy Never Broke Again | 2,052,942,250 |\n| 14 | Taylor Swift | 2,042,557,032 |\n| 15 | Rauw Alejandro | 2,033,366,250 |\n| 16 | Ed Sheeran | 2,030,201,798 |\n| 17 | Eminem | 1,939,868,872 |\n| 18 | Justin Bieber | 1,932,017,356 |\n| 19 | Bizarrap | 1,896,575,377 |\n| 20 | TWICE | 1,894,352,427 |\n| 21 | Imagine Dragons | 1,774,257,488 |\n| 22 | Ozuna | 1,719,602,688 |\n| 23 | Romeo Santos | 1,682,116,543 |\n| 24 | Grupo Firme | 1,635,993,453 |\n| 25 | Coldplay | 1,591,230,091 |\n| 26 | Bruno Mars | 1,581,966,370 |\n| 27 | Feid | 1,574,592,904 |\n| 28 | Los \u00c1ngeles Azules | 1,506,971,627 |\n| 29 | J Balvin | 1,481,911,306 |\n\n**Note:** The data appears to be truncated at artist #30, as the output was cut off.

Inspirational Music Quotes for Introduction\n\nThe Radio World API provided a collection of quotes, though not all are specifically music-related. Here are the quotes that could be used in your report introduction:\n\n1. \"There must be a reason why photographers are not very good at verbal communication. I think we get lazy.\" - Annie Leibovitz\n\nUnfortunately, the quotes returned were not specifically focused on music, and the data appears to be truncated as well. The API indicated there are 405,728 total quotes available, but only 7 quotes were fully returned in the response, and none were categorized under music.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've provided YouTube's top artists from 2022 (though the list is incomplete, showing only the top 29 artists), but was unable to retrieve the current global Spotify top tracks due to subscription limitations. The quotes provided are not specifically music-related and are limited in number. To complete your comprehensive music trends report, you would need to upgrade the Spotify Scraper subscription, request more complete data from the YouTube API, and specifically request music-related quotes.",

However, I should note that the tool output was truncated, showing only partial information about the first release. Here's what I could gather:\n\n- The most recent release appears to be a single by PARTYNEXTDOOR\n- The album ID is 6mHQX0imf1GfctUD5cQEWi\n- The release is available in multiple markets including Canada\n\nUnfortunately, due to the truncated output, I cannot provide a complete list of new releases in Canada. The data was cut off after showing partial details of just the first album.\n\n## 2. Music Videos from Artist ID 16775 on Genius\n\nI retrieved music video information from Genius for artist ID 16775. The output shows:\n\n- A video titled \"Genius & Dropbox Present Visual Art Exhibit 'Lyrics To Life'\"\n- This appears to be an event/exhibit video rather than a traditional music video\n- The video is 72,322 milliseconds long (approximately 1 minute and 12 seconds)\n- It features multiple artists with IDs 92, 16775, and 26577\n\nUnfortunately, the output was also truncated, and I cannot see if there were additional videos. Additionally, the tool doesn't explicitly identify which artist has ID 16775, so I cannot confirm whose videos these are.\n\n## 3. Song Suggestions for \"Summer Nights\"\n\nUsing Shazam's auto-complete feature, I found the following song suggestions related to \"summer nights\":\n\n- \"summer nights\"\n- \"summer nights mid july\"\n- \"summer nights rascal flatts\"\n\nThis is a limited set of suggestions that appears to be auto-complete terms rather than comprehensive song recommendations. The tool provided only search terms without details about the actual songs, artists, or release dates.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your music discovery session, I've gathered some initial information across different platforms, but all three tool results were limited or truncated. The Spotify data shows PARTYNEXTDOOR has a recent release in Canada but doesn't provide a complete list of new releases. The Genius data shows one video related to an art exhibit featuring multiple artists, but doesn't clearly identify artist 16775. The Shazam data provides only three search suggestions related to \"summer nights\" without detailed song information. To create a truly diverse playlist, you would need more complete data from these sources.",

    "final_answer": "# Comprehensive Music Research Project Analysis\n\n## 1. Afrobeats Songs with 'Love' in the Title\n\nI used the Shazam auto-complete tool to find Afrobeats songs with 'love' in the title. Unfortunately, the tool returned very limited results, showing only one hint: 'love afrobeats'. This doesn't provide specific song titles as requested. For a comprehensive research project, you would need to use a different search method or tool to find Afrobeats songs with 'love' in the title.\n\nHowever, from the Billboard chart data retrieved, I can note that 'Love Nwantiti (Ah Ah Ah)' by CKay was ranked #6 on the Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart for the week of October 8, 2022, which is one example of an Afrobeats song with 'love' in the title.\n\n## 2. Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs Chart\n\nThe Billboard API provided the U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart for the week of October 8, 2022. Here are the top songs from that chart:\n\n1. \"Calm Down\" by Rema & Selena Gomez (28 weeks on chart, peak position: #1)\n2. \"Last Last\" by Burna Boy (20 weeks on chart, peak position: #1)\n3. \"Free Mind\" by Tems (28 weeks on chart, peak position: #1)\n4. \"Essence\" by Wizkid Featuring Justin Bieber & Tems (28 weeks on chart, peak position: #1)\n5. \"Ku Lo Sa\" by Oxlade (11 weeks on chart, peak position: #5)\n6. \"Love Nwantiti (Ah Ah Ah)\" by CKay (28 weeks on chart, peak position: #1)\n7. \"Peru\" by Fireboy DML & Ed Sheeran (28 weeks on chart, peak position: #1)\n8. \"Higher\" by Tems (position details truncated in the tool output)\n\n**Limitation**: It's important to note that this chart data is from October 2022, not the latest chart as requested. Additionally, the output was truncated after the 8th entry, so we don't have the complete chart information.\n\n## 3. Drake's 'Certified Lover Boy' Album Information\n\nThere appears to be a mismatch in the data retrieval. Instead of information about Drake's 'Certified Lover Boy' album, the Spotify Web tool returned information about Green Day's 'American Idiot' album from 2004. The album ID used (5dN7F9DV0Qg1XRdIgW8rke) corresponds to Green Day's album, not Drake's. Additionally, the output was truncated, providing only partial information about the album.\n\nTo properly analyze Drake's 'Certified Lover Boy' album for your research project, you would need to use the correct album ID and retrieve the complete information.\n\n## 4. Billboard's Top 5 Greatest Artists of All Time\n\nUnfortunately, the Billboard Greatest of All Time Artists tool encountered an error: \"getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND billboard.cctuex9y9o7b.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com\". This appears to be a server connection issue, and no data was returned. Therefore, I cannot provide information about Billboard's top 5 greatest artists of all time as requested.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your comprehensive music research project, I was able to provide partial information about the Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart from October 2022, including one Afrobeats song with 'love' in the title (\"Love Nwantiti\" by CKay). However, the tools returned limited or incorrect information for most of your requests. To complete your research project effectively, you would need to:\n\n1. Use a different method to find more Afrobeats songs with 'love' in the title\n2. Obtain the latest Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart (the data provided is from 2022)\n3. Retrieve the correct information about Drake's 'Certified Lover Boy' album\n4. Find an alternative source for Billboard's top 5 greatest artists of all time\n\nThese limitations significantly impact the comprehensiveness of the analysis for your music research project comparing different music cultures and trends.",

These categories are organized into two main sections:\n\n### Genres (25 categories):\nAfrican, Arabic, Blues, Bollywood & Indian, Classical, Country & Americana, Dance & Electronic, Decades, Family, Hip-Hop, Indie & Alternative, Jazz, K-Pop, Latin, Metal, Pop, R&B & Soul, Reggae & Caribbean, Rock, Seasons, Soundtracks & Musicals, Turkish Folk & Traditional, Turkish Hip-Hop, Turkish Pop, Turkish Rock\n\n### Moods & Moments (7 categories):\nChill, Commute, Energy Boosters, Feel Good, Focus, Party, Romance\n\nThese categories can help you organize your music discovery session by emotional tone or specific genre interests.\n\n## 2. Radio Station Genres\n\nThe 50K Radio Stations tool returned very limited information about available genres. Despite the tool description mentioning access to 60,000+ radio stations worldwide, the output only returned a single generic category:\n- Music (ID: 62)\n\nThis result is significantly limited and doesn't provide the comprehensive genre list that was requested. The tool may require additional parameters or a different approach to retrieve more detailed genre information.\n\n## 3. Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' on SoundCloud\n\nThe SoundCloud Scraper tool returned an error when attempting to retrieve information about Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' track:\n\n**Error**: \"HQ audio is not available to BASIC users. Please subscribe to a higher plan.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the tool was unable to provide any metadata or download links for this track due to subscription limitations.\n\n## 4. The Weeknd on YouTube Music\n\nThe YouTube Music API search for 'The Weeknd' returned partial results (the output was cut off). From what was returned:\n\n### Top Result:\n- Artist: The Weeknd\n- Subscribers: 249M\n- Category: Top result\n\n### Songs (partial list):\n1. **Timeless**\n   - Artists: The Weeknd, Playboi Carti\n   - Duration: 4:16\n   - Explicit: Yes\n   - Video ID: a4O-abCXsfA\n\n2. **Untitled Track with Anitta**\n   - Artists: The Weeknd, Anitta\n   - Duration: 5:02\n   - (The data was cut off here)\n\nThe results were incomplete as the tool output was truncated, showing only 2 songs out of the requested 15 results.\n\n## Summary\n\nYour music discovery session can primarily benefit from YouTube Music's well-organized mood and genre categories. The radio station genre information was extremely limited, and the SoundCloud track information was unavailable due to subscription restrictions. The search results for The Weeknd were incomplete but showed that YouTube Music offers detailed artist information with associated content. For a diverse listening experience, YouTube Music appears to offer the most structured categorization system among the sources we explored.",

Taylor Swift Information\n\nThe Spotify Web API provided the following details about Taylor Swift as a potential headliner:\n\n- **Name:** Taylor Swift\n- **Spotify ID:** 06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02\n- **Followers:** 122,340,661\n- **Genres:** Pop\n- **Popularity:** 100/100 (maximum popularity score)\n- **Images:** Available in three different resolutions\n\nThis confirms Taylor Swift's massive popularity, making her a significant potential headliner, though as an independent artist event, it's worth noting she may not align with your independent artist focus.\n\n## Summary\n\nBased on the information gathered, you have some initial data to start planning your music-themed event celebrating independent artists. You have a list of top independent albums from 2022 (though not current), partial information about influential Genius contributors, confirmation that Indonesia has radio stations in the database (though no specific stations were provided), and detailed information about Taylor Swift's popularity as a potential headliner. To proceed with your planning, you would need more current Billboard data, complete Genius contributor information, specific Indonesian radio station details, and possibly information about more independent artists who might be more aligned with your event's theme.",

I heard someone created a Spotify account called 'quarantunes' with some interesting playlists - would love to see what they've curated. There's also this album that came out during isolation with a folklore theme - I think its Spotify ID is '2fenSS68JI1h4Fo296JfGr'.

    "final_answer": "# K-pop Music Festival Playlist Research\n\n## BLACKPINK Information\nUsing the K-POP girl-groups tool, I found the following information about BLACKPINK:\n- Group Name: BLACKPINK (Korean: \ube14\ub799\ud551\ud06c)\n- Debut Date: August 8, 2016\n- Company: YG Entertainment\n- Members: 4 (same as original members)\n- Active Status: Yes\n\nThe tool provided basic profile information but did not include details about their discography, achievements, or individual members.\n\n## IU's Song 'Eight' featuring Suga\nThe YouTube Music API tool was used to retrieve information about this song, but the output was incomplete. The tool returned only partial data about video availability across countries, but cut off before providing actual song details such as release date, duration, or collaboration specifics between IU and Suga. This information is insufficient to provide details about the song.\n\n## K-pop Songs on Billboard Global 200\nThe Billboard Global 200 chart (dated November 25, 2023) shows the following K-pop entries:\n- Jung Kook's \"Standing Next To You\" at position #2 (previously #1)\n\nIt's important to note that the tool output was cut off after only showing the top 5 entries on the chart, so there may be additional K-pop songs that weren't visible in the results. The visible top 5 included non-K-pop artists like Tate McRae, Dua Lipa, Jack Harlow, and Taylor Swift.\n\n## TWICE's Albums\nThe MusiclinkssApi tool returned several TWICE albums, including:\n- THIS IS FOR (DELUXE) - Release date: July 14, 2025 (likely a placeholder date)\n- THIS IS FOR - Release date: July 11, 2025 (likely a placeholder date)\n- STRATEGY - Release date: December 6, 2024 (likely a placeholder date)\n- DIVE - Release date: July 17, 2024 (likely a placeholder date)\n- I GOT YOU (Voyage ver.) - Release date: February 6, 2024\n- THE REMIXES - Release date: November 22, 2023\n- READY TO BE - Release date: (date not fully visible)\n\nThe tool output was cut off, so this is not a complete list of TWICE's discography. Additionally, some of the future release dates appear to be placeholders rather than actual confirmed dates.\n\n## Extended Version of BTS's 'Dynamite'\nThe Miza song trimming/extending tool returned an error: \"Endpoint '/ytdlp' does not exist\". Therefore, I was unable to create the requested 10-minute extended version of BTS's 'Dynamite' for your special segment.\n\n## Summary\nI've gathered partial information about BLACKPINK as a group, identified Jung Kook's presence on the Billboard Global 200, and provided some of TWICE's albums. However, I couldn't retrieve complete information about IU's song 'Eight' featuring Suga, and the attempt to create an extended version of BTS's 'Dynamite' failed due to a tool error. For a complete K-pop festival playlist, you would need additional information that wasn't fully available through these tools.",

Here's what's currently popular:\n\n### Trending Songs:\n- \"Drum Show\" by Twenty One Pilots (Album: Drum Show)\n- \"Everybody Scream\" by Florence + The Machine\n\n**Note: The tool output was truncated and only showed the first two trending songs out of what appears to be a larger list of 20 items. The complete trending information is not available in the results.**\n\n## 2. Shakira Artist Details\n\nThe Spotify Artist Details tool provided comprehensive information about Shakira:\n\n- **Name:** Shakira\n- **Popularity Score:** 87/100\n- **Followers:** 30,118,430\n- **Genres:** Colombian pop, dance pop, Latin pop, pop\n- **Spotify URL:** https://open.spotify.com/artist/0EmeFodog0BfCgMzAIvKQp\n- **Profile Images:** Available in three sizes (640x640, 320x320, 160x160)\n\n## 3. Artists Similar to Bad Bunny\n\n**Error:** The Spotify Related Artists tool returned an error message: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\" Unfortunately, no information about artists similar to Bad Bunny could be retrieved.\n\n## 4. YouTube Music Profile of Colors Studios\n\nThe YouTube Music API successfully retrieved information about the COLORS channel:\n\n- **Channel Name:** COLORS\n- **Notable Playlists:**\n  - \"ALL COLORS SHOWS\" (70M views)\n  - Another playlist with 12M views\n\n**Note: The tool output was truncated and didn't provide complete information about all playlists or channel details.**\n\n## 5. Billboard Chart Rankings for Spain\n\n**Access Limitation:** The Billboard-API returned a notice stating: \"This endpoint is available on the Ultra plan and above. If you want to access this endpoint, please upgrade your plan.\" Therefore, no Billboard chart data for Spain could be retrieved.\n\n## Summary\n\nYour music discovery session yielded mixed results. We successfully obtained information about Shakira as an artist (showing her immense popularity with over 30 million followers) and partial trending information from Spotify Spain (featuring Twenty One Pilots and Florence + The Machine). We also confirmed that COLORS has a significant presence on YouTube Music with highly viewed playlists. However, we couldn't retrieve information about artists similar to Bad Bunny due to an API error, and the Billboard chart data for Spain requires a premium subscription.

BTS's Album 'Love Yourself: Tear'\nI attempted to gather information about BTS's album 'Love Yourself: Tear' using the Spotify API, but unfortunately, the tool returned a null result for the album ID provided (2jVvPl7Iw3NxxGuCxIMa8S). This could be due to regional restrictions, an incorrect album ID, or an API limitation.\n\nHowever, I was able to gather some general information about BTS through the K-POP boy-groups tool:\n\n**BTS Group Information:**\n- Full Name: BTS (Bangtan Boys)\n- Korean Name: \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8\n- Debut Date: June 13, 2013\n- Company: Big Hit\n- Members: 7 (Original members: 7)\n- Fanclub Name: ARMY\n- Active Status: Yes\n- Profile Link: https://dbkpop.com/group/bts/\n\n## 2. Lyrics for 'Fake Love'\nI attempted to retrieve the lyrics for 'Fake Love' using the SoundCloud Scraper tool, but it returned an error stating that the provided URL is not a valid SoundCloud track URL. The tool was specifically looking for a SoundCloud URL, but a Spotify URL was provided instead. To get the lyrics, we would need to use a different tool or provide a correct URL format.\n\n## 3. Random Radio Stations for K-pop\nThe Radio World tool that was used to find random radio stations returned a 500 Internal Server Error. This means the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. Unfortunately, I cannot provide the list of 5 random radio stations that might play K-pop as requested.\n\n## 4. Shazam Statistics for 'Fake Love'\nThe Shazam tool was called to retrieve statistics on how many times 'Fake Love' has been Shazamed using the key '466628886', but no output was provided in the results. This could be due to an API limitation, an incorrect key, or a failure in the API response.\n\n## Summary\nUnfortunately, most of the tools used encountered errors or returned incomplete information. I was only able to provide basic information about BTS as a group, but could not gather specific details about the 'Love Yourself: Tear' album, the lyrics for 'Fake Love', radio stations that play K-pop, or Shazam statistics. To build a comprehensive music discovery dashboard for BTS, you would need to try alternative tools or APIs, or troubleshoot the issues with the current tools.",

    "final_answer": "# Global Music Trends Presentation Information\n\n## 1. Jungkook from BTS\n\nThe K-POP Idols tool provided detailed background information about Jungkook:\n\n- **Full Name**: Jeon Jungkook (Korean: \uc804\uc815\uad6d)\n- **Stage Name**: Jungkook (Korean: \uc815\uad6d)\n- **Date of Birth**: September 1, 1997\n- **Group**: BTS\n- **Country**: South Korea\n- **Birthplace**: Busan\n- **Height**: 178 cm\n- **Weight**: 66 kg\n- **Gender**: Male\n\nThe tool successfully returned basic profile information, though it lacks details about his career progression, musical achievements, and solo work that would be valuable for a comprehensive presentation.\n\n## 2. Most Viewed YouTube Music Videos from 2017\n\nThe MusicData API provided information about top YouTube videos from 2017:\n\n1. **Luis Fonsi - Despacito ft. Daddy Yankee** - 8,562,662,836 views\n2. **Ed Sheeran - Shape of You** - 6,346,098,427 views\n3. **Ed Sheeran - Perfect** - 3,819,062,733 views\n4. **J Balvin, Willy William - Mi Gente** - 3,405,488,006 views\n5. **Dua Lipa - New Rules** - 3,083,848,302 views\n6. **Imagine Dragons - Believer** - 2,715,849,812 views\n7. **Natti Natasha \u274c Ozuna - Criminal** - 2,640,217,806 views\n8. **Becky G, Bad Bunny - Mayores** - 2,468,324,503 views\n9. **Luis Fonsi, Demi Lovato - \u00c9chame La Culpa** - 2,378,756,653 views\n10. **Bruno Mars - That's What I Like** - 2,316,943,351 views\n11. **The Chainsmokers & Coldplay - Something Just Like This** - 2,306,480,090 views\n\n**Note**: The output appears to be truncated after the 11th entry, so there may be additional videos in the complete ranking that aren't shown here.\n\n## 3. Halsey's Lyrics\n\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool provided lyrics from her song \"Bells in Santa Fe\":\n\nKey excerpts include:\n- \"Don't call me by my name / All of this is temporary / Watch as I slip away for your sake / All of this is temporary\"\n- \"Well, maybe I could hold you in the dark / You won't even notice me depart\"\n- \"So don't wait for me, don't wait for me, wait-ah / It's not a happy ending\"\n\nThese lyrics showcase Halsey's poetic style and themes of impermanence and departure, which could be useful examples of Western pop lyricism.\n\n## 4. Ludovico Einaudi on SoundCloud\n\nThe SoundCloud Scraper provided partial information about Ludovico Einaudi:\n\n- **Name**: Ludovico Einaudi\n- **Profile**: https://soundcloud.com/ludovicoeinaudi\n- **Created**: May 25, 2011\n- **Description**: \"Ludovico Einaudi is known the world over through films and TV. His music has featured in titles including Black Swan, Doctor Zhivago, This is England and many more.\"\n- **Follower Count**: 2,063,385\n- **Track Count**: 579\n- **Playlist Count**: 90\n- **Location**: Turin, Italy\n- **Verified**: Yes\n\nThe tool returned only the first 5 results (out of 10 total), and the second result appears to be truncated. This provides a basic profile but lacks specific information about his music style, compositions, or classical crossover work.\n\n## 5. The Weeknd's Discography\n\nThe Spotify Artist Albums tool failed to return useful information. Instead of album data, it returned an HTML error page. This means we don't have information about The Weeknd's discography to analyze his career progression.\n\n## 6. Billie Eilish's YouTube Music Profile\n\nThe YouTube Music API tool returned a 500 Internal Server Error, meaning we don't have any information about Billie Eilish's artist profile or her impact on modern pop.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your comprehensive music presentation, I've been able to provide:\n- Basic biographical information about Jungkook from BTS\n- A partial list of the most viewed YouTube music videos from 2017 (showing Latin music dominance with \"Despacito\" and strong performances from Ed Sheeran)\n- Lyrics from Halsey's song \"Bells in Santa Fe\" as an example of Western pop\n- Basic profile information about Ludovico Einaudi on SoundCloud\n\nUnfortunately, two of the requested information sources failed:\n- The Weeknd's discography (returned an HTML error page)\n- Billie Eilish's YouTube Music profile (returned a 500 Internal Server Error)\n\nYou may need to seek alternative sources for information about The Weeknd and Billie Eilish to complete your presentation.",

I'm also trying to find some profiles of that Italian pianist who creates those minimalist contemporary classical pieces - maybe just a handful of the most relevant ones? I've been following that Canadian R&B artist with the distinctive hairstyle who performed at the Super Bowl - what's his complete discography look like?

The album contains 15 songs, though the specific song titles weren't provided in the tool output, only their reference IDs.\n\n## 2. Top 10 Most Streamed Songs on Spotify from 2020\nThe MusicData API provided the following top 10 most streamed songs on Spotify from 2020:\n\n1. The Weeknd - Blinding Lights (4,518,199,117 streams)\n2. Glass Animals - Heat Waves (3,170,674,064 streams)\n3. Dua Lipa - Levitating (2,175,048,691 streams)\n4. The Weeknd - Save Your Tears (2,140,208,617 streams)\n5. Bad Bunny - D\u00c1KITI (2,069,113,295 streams)\n6. BTS - Dynamite (1,947,622,983 streams)\n7. Lauv - I Like Me Better (1,854,997,960 streams)\n8. Conan Gray - Heather (1,805,576,534 streams)\n9. Ava Max - Sweet but Psycho (1,750,480,784 streams)\n10. Powfu - death bed (coffee for your head) (1,725,602,267 streams)\n\nNote: The tool actually returned more than 10 songs (up to #18), but the output was cut off mid-response.\n\n## 3. Current Trending Music Videos in Japan on YouTube\nThe MusicData API for YouTube trending videos in Japan returned no data. The tool was called correctly with the country code 'jp', but no output was provided.\n\n## 4. Taylor Swift's Discography on Spotify\nThe Spotify Artist Albums tool returned partial information about Taylor Swift's discography. While it confirmed her artist ID (06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02) and showed that she has albums available on Spotify across numerous markets worldwide, the complete list of albums was cut off in the response. Only one partial album entry was visible in the results.\n\n## 5. Billboard Catalog Albums Chart (January 15, 2023)\nThe Billboard API returned an error message: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\" Unfortunately, no chart data was available for the requested date.\n\n## 6. Personalized Radio Playlist Based on Billie Eilish\nThe Spotify Get Radio Playlist tool successfully generated a radio playlist based on Billie Eilish's music style. The tool returned a Spotify playlist URI: spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E4oee5QSbfqLN. This can be used to access the curated playlist that matches Billie Eilish's musical style.\n\n## Summary\nFor your music-themed party, I was able to gather complete information about Halsey's 'Manic' album release date, the top 10 most streamed songs on Spotify from 2020, and a personalized radio playlist based on Billie Eilish's style. However, I encountered limitations with the other requests: no data was returned for trending YouTube videos in Japan, Taylor Swift's discography information was incomplete, and the Billboard Catalog Albums chart was unavailable due to an API error. You can use the successfully retrieved information to create playlists representing different artists and 2020 streaming trends, but you may need to seek alternative sources for the Japanese music trends and complete discography information.",

Also, I've been wondering what musical content is capturing attention in the Land of the Rising Sun right now. And you know that young artist with the distinctive whisper-singing style who broke through with 'Ocean Eyes'? I'd be interested in seeing her complete body of work (her unique identifier starts with '06HL4'). I was also hoping to see which established classics were charting mid-January last year. Lastly, I've been really into that K-pop girl group known for 'How You Like That' - could you suggest some similar music that might match their energy?"

This suggests either a limitation in the database's coverage of children's programming or an issue with the search parameters. You may need to explore alternative sources for family-friendly radio station recommendations.\n\n## 6. Complete Lyrics for 'Baby Shark'\nThe YouTube Music API returned no lyrics for 'Baby Shark' (the browse_id 'MPLYt_dkJQcvFeQpN' may not have been correct for this song). You'll need to find these lyrics through another source for your event songbook.\n\n## Summary\nI was able to provide information on top independent albums that might appeal to parents and detailed information about Taylor Swift as an artist. However, several of the requested items returned no results or errors, including the lyrics for both songs, information about 'Baby Shark', and family-friendly radio stations. For a complete music-themed event package, you'll need to supplement this information with additional research from other sources.",

Current Trending Songs on Twitter\nThe Billboard-API successfully returned data for Hot Trending Songs powered by Twitter, though it's important to note this data is from November 6, 2021, so it's not current:\n\n**Top 10 Twitter Trending Songs (as of November 6, 2021):**\n1. \"Butter\" by BTS (1 week at #1)\n2. \"Rock With You\" by SEVENTEEN (new entry)\n3. \"Permission To Dance\" by BTS (down from #1)\n4. \"Money\" by Lisa (down from #2)\n5. \"Lalisa\" by Lisa (down from #3)\n6. \"Savage\" by aespa (holding at #6)\n7. \"Spaceman\" by Mew Suppasit (new entry)\n8. \"Tamed-Dashed\" by ENHYPEN (down from #5)\n9. \"My Universe\" by Coldplay x BTS (down from #4)\n10. \"Dynamite\" by BTS (up from #12)\n\n## 4. Most Viewed English-Language Music Videos (Last 24 Hours)\nThe MusicData API successfully returned the current top English-language music videos on YouTube:\n\n1. Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars - \"Die With A Smile\" (2,735,727 views)\n2. Linkin Park - \"The Emptiness Machine\" (1,467,101 views)\n3. Crazy Frog - \"Axel F\" (1,466,272 views)\n4. Sabrina Carpenter - \"Taste\" (1,254,276 views)\n5. Sabrina Carpenter - \"Espresso\" (1,180,691 views)\n6. The Weeknd - \"Save Your Tears\" (1,131,318 views)\n7. Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth - \"See You Again\" (1,079,561 views)\n8. Linkin Park - \"Numb\" (1,051,090 views)\n9. Megan Thee Stallion feat. RM - \"Neva Play\" (956,931 views)\n10. *NSYNC - \"Bye Bye Bye\" (from Deadpool and Wolverine) (948,483 views)\n\n## 5. Information about The Beatles\nThe YouTube Music API returned partial information about The Beatles, including some of their albums:\n- \"Beatles '64\" (Music from the Disney+ Documentary)\n- \"Let It Be (Super Deluxe)\"\n- \"Abbey R\" (appears to be truncated, likely \"Abbey Road\")\n\nUnfortunately, the response was cut off, providing only limited information about their discography.\n\n## 6. Top YouTube Artists from 2022\nThe MusicData API successfully returned the top YouTube artists of 2022 based on views:\n\n1. Bad Bunny (10,046,995,039 views)\n2. Blackpink (4,726,453,501 views)\n3. BTS (4,719,656,705 views)\n4. Karol G (4,164,397,009 views)\n5. Anuel AA (3,626,724,216 views)\n6. Ozuna (3,584,734,537 views)\n7. Mar\u00edlia Mendon\u00e7a (3,584,311,797 views)\n8. J Balvin (3,582,202,931 views)\n9. Daddy Yankee (3,514,088,277 views)\n10. Rauw Alejandro (3,194,700,937 views)\n\nThe data includes additional artists beyond the top 10, though the response appears to be truncated after the 30th entry.\n\n## 7. Spotify Track Data for 'Hey Jude'\nThe Spotify API returned track data, but it appears to be for a different song titled \"In Control (feat. Selin)\" by Mahmut Orhan, Ali Arutan, and Selin, rather than \"Hey Jude\" by The Beatles. The response shows details about this unrelated track including album information, artists, duration (179,232 ms), and that it's not marked as explicit content. The response was also truncated.\n\n## Summary\nYour comprehensive music history presentation will be limited by several data gaps. Two Billboard tools failed to return data, the Twitter trending songs are from 2021 (not current), The Beatles information was incomplete, and the Spotify data retrieved was for an incorrect song. However, you do have solid current data on trending English-language music videos and the top YouTube artists from 2022. I recommend seeking alternative data sources for the missing information, particularly for Billboard's greatest artists/songs and accurate Beatles data including \"Hey Jude.\"",

Top Albums Globally on Spotify\nUnfortunately, the Spotify Scraper tool returned an error indicating that this endpoint is not available to basic users and requires a subscription to a higher plan. I cannot provide the top albums globally on Spotify based on the available data.\n\n## 2. Current Music Trends in Germany on YouTube Music\nThe YouTube Music API successfully returned trending artists in Germany. Here are the top 5 trending artists:\n\n1. **AYLIVA** - Rank #1 with 782K subscribers (trend: neutral)\n2. **Linkin Park** - Rank #2 with 23.8M subscribers (trend: neutral)\n3. **Apache 207** - Rank #3 with 1.51M subscribers (trend: up)\n4. **Bonez MC** - Rank #4 with 246K subscribers (trend: neutral)\n5. **[Incomplete data]** - Rank #5 with 28.5M subscribers\n\nNote: The data appears to be truncated for the 5th artist and potentially more trending artists beyond these five.\n\n## 3. Information about Ludovico Einaudi on SoundCloud\nThe SoundCloud search returned information about Ludovico Einaudi's profile:\n\n- **Verified artist** with over 2 million followers (2,063,385)\n- Based in Turin, Italy\n- Has 579 tracks and 90 playlists on the platform\n- Joined SoundCloud in May 2011\n- Known for music featured in films like Black Swan, Doctor Zhivago, and This is England\n\nThe search also found other profiles with the same name, but the data appears to be truncated.\n\n## 4. New Music Releases in the UK on Spotify\nThe Spotify New Releases tool returned an error message: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\" I cannot provide information about new music releases in the UK.\n\n## 5. Details about Coldplay from Spotify's Artist Database\nThe Spotify Web tool successfully returned information about Coldplay:\n\n- **Massive following** with 59,718,724 followers\n- Very high popularity score of 93/100\n- Artist ID: 4gzpq5DPGxSnKTe4SA8HAU\n- Official Spotify URL: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4gzpq5DPGxSnKTe4SA8HAU\n\n## 6. Radio Station Recommendations for Festival Attendees\nThe Kooed endpoint returned HTML code rather than structured data about radio stations. The response appears to be the website's HTML structure rather than the specific radio station data needed. I cannot provide radio station recommendations based on this output.\n\n## 7. Curated Radio Playlist Based on Taylor Swift\nThe Spotify Web Radio Playlist tool returned a single playlist URI based on Taylor Swift (artist URI: spotify:artist:06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02):\n- Playlist URI: spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E4AfEUiirXPyP\n\nHowever, the actual contents of this playlist (tracks, artists, etc.) were not provided in the response.\n\n## Summary\nFor your global music festival planning, I was able to gather partial information about trending artists in Germany (with AYLIVA, Linkin Park, and Apache 207 leading), detailed profile information about Ludovico Einaudi on SoundCloud (a verified artist with over 2 million followers), and confirmation that Coldplay has nearly 60 million followers on Spotify with a very high popularity score. \n\nUnfortunately, several tools returned errors or incomplete data, including the global Spotify albums rankings, UK new releases, radio station recommendations, and the full contents of the Taylor Swift-based playlist. To make fully informed decisions for your festival lineup, you would need to seek additional data sources or resolve the API access issues encountered with these tools.",

I'd also love to see some random lyrics from Halsey's songs and check out what's trending with top Vietnamese music videos on YouTube. While you're at it, could you pull up the latest music releases in Japan from Spotify? I'm curious about K-pop too - what can you tell me about BTS? Also, I've been wondering about Billie Eilish's 'bad guy' - can you look up search results for it on Shazam? Finally, I'd appreciate some recommendations for rock radio stations to round out my musical journey.",
    "hard_rewrite": "I've been exploring different music scenes lately and feeling nostalgic about that Coldplay song with the French Revolution theme. I wonder what other tracks would play after it? Also, I've been curious about what Halsey's lyrics are actually saying - sometimes her words really hit deep. My Vietnamese friend mentioned their music videos get massive viewership - I wonder what's trending there? I was also hoping to discover what's fresh in the Japanese music scene right now. My sister is obsessed with that 7-member Korean group - the one with the massive international ARMY fanbase - and keeps talking about them. And that catchy Billie Eilish song where she whispers 'duh' - what comes up when people try to identify it? I've been wanting to find some good rock stations to listen to while working too."

    "final_answer": "# Music Festival Planning Information Summary\n\n## 1. Billboard's Top 10 Greatest Songs of All Time\n\nThe Billboard_v2 tool returned an error when attempting to retrieve the Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs. The specific error was a host not found error (ENOTFOUND), indicating that the database server was unreachable. Unfortunately, this means I cannot provide you with Billboard's official top 10 greatest songs for your classics section.\n\n## 2. Taylor Swift-Inspired Radio Playlist\n\nThe Spotify tool successfully created a Taylor Swift-inspired radio playlist. The tool returned:\n- A playlist with URI: spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E4AfEUiirXPyP\n\nThis playlist can be used for your pop stage. To access it, you would need to open this URI in the Spotify application or web player.\n\n## 3. YouTube's Trending Artists from 2022\n\nThe MusicData API successfully retrieved YouTube's top artists from 2022. Here are the top 10:\n\n1. Bad Bunny (7,321,534,148 views)\n2. Blackpink (4,618,844,818 views)\n3. BTS (3,933,034,042 views)\n4. Karol G (2,932,040,282 views)\n5. Shakira (2,698,413,976 views)\n6. The Weeknd (2,579,173,236 views)\n7. Henrique e Juliano (2,468,399,378 views)\n8. Sidhu Moose Wala (2,439,164,311 views)\n9. Gusttavo Lima (2,361,844,231 views)\n10. Mar\u00edlia Mendon\u00e7a (2,316,860,838 views)\n\nNote: The tool returned data for the top 30 artists, but the output was truncated after artist #30. Taylor Swift ranked #14 with 2,042,557,032 views.\n\n## 4. German Radio Stations Playing Pop Music\n\nThe 50K Radio Stations tool returned no results when searching for pop music stations in Germany (country_id: 50). The response indicated success but with zero stations found (total: 0, data: []). This suggests either there are no stations matching your criteria in the database, or there might be an issue with the search parameters.\n\n## 5. The Weeknd's Recent Releases on YouTube Music\n\nThe YouTube Music API search for \"The Weeknd\" returned partial results:\n\n- Top result: The Weeknd (artist with 249M subscribers)\n- Recent song: \"Timeless\" by The Weeknd featuring Playboi Carti (4:16 duration)\n\nThe output was truncated, so only limited information about The Weeknd's recent releases was provided. The tool did not return a complete list of recent releases as requested.\n\n## 6. Twitter-Trending Songs\n\nThe Billboard-API successfully retrieved the Hot Trending Songs Powered by Twitter chart from June 3, 2023. The top trending songs were:\n\n1. \"Eve, Psyche and The Bluebeard's Wife\" by LE SSERAFIM (new entry)\n2. \"The Best\" by Tina Turner (new entry)\n3. \"Act Bad\" by Diddy, City Girls & Fabolous (new entry)\n4. \"What's Love Got To Do With It\" by Tina Turner (new entry)\n5. \"My Wrist\" by Yeat With Young Thug (new entry)\n6. \"Pistolz & Pearlz\" by Kodak Black (new entry)\n7. \"Show Me How\" by Foo Fighters (new entry)\n8. \"Barbie World\" by Nicki Minaj & Ice Spice (with Aqua) (output truncated)\n\nNote that the output was truncated after the 8th entry, so the complete top 10 is not available.\n\n## 7. Music Festival Jingle File\n\nThe Miza tool attempted to retrieve a file with path 'MUSIC2023', but the output appears to be binary data in JFIF format (likely a JPEG image), not an audio file. The binary data is partially displayed but is not usable in this format. This suggests that either the path was incorrect or the file is not an audio file suitable for a festival jingle.\n\n## Final Summary\n\nFor your comprehensive music festival planning:\n\n1. **Classics Section**: Unable to provide Billboard's top 10 greatest songs due to a database connection error.\n2. **Pop Stage**: Successfully created a Taylor Swift-inspired Spotify radio playlist (URI: spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E4AfEUiirXPyP).\n3. **Contemporary Performers**: Identified YouTube's top trending artists from 2022, led by Bad Bunny, Blackpink, and BTS.\n4. **International Promotion**: No German pop radio stations were found in the database.\n5. **R&B Segment**: Limited information on The Weeknd's recent releases was obtained, with only one song (\"Timeless\") specifically identified.\n6. **Social Media Campaign**: Retrieved Twitter-trending songs from June 2023, with LE SSERAFIM and Tina Turner leading the chart.\n7. **Festival Jingle**: The retrieved file appears to be an image rather than an audio file, making it unsuitable for use as a jingle.\n\nSeveral of the tools provided incomplete information or encountered errors, which may impact your ability to finalize the festival program by tomorrow. I recommend seeking alternative sources for the missing information, particularly for the classics section and German radio stations.",

I'd love to see Billboard's all-time greatest hits (just the top 10), and I'm curious about which songs were trending on Twitter in mid-2023. Also, which artists dominated YouTube in 2022? Finally, I'm looking to expand my playlist with some pop music recommendations, particularly anything that has a similar vibe to The Weeknd's style.",
    "hard_rewrite": "I've been feeling out of touch with recent music trends. I wonder what songs have been making waves in the last couple years? It would be fascinating to see which tracks Billboard considers truly timeless, maybe their top 10 all-time classics. Also curious what Twitter users were buzzing about musically around mid-2023. Which artists dominated YouTube viewership in 2022? I've been enjoying atmospheric pop lately - especially that Canadian artist with the distinctive falsetto who did 'Blinding Lights' - and would love to discover similar vibes."

    "final_answer": "# Global Music Festival Content Collection Results\n\n## 1. Classical Music Playlists on SoundCloud\nThe SoundCloud Scraper tool was used to search for classical music playlists, but unfortunately, the tool did not return any results. The output appears to be empty despite providing the search term 'classical music' and optional parameters for limit and genre filtering.\n\n## 2. Current Top 10 Popular Songs in the USA\nThe Spotify Charts tool provided information about the top songs in the USA, but the results were incomplete. Only the first two entries were returned:\n\n1. \"Golden\" by HUNTR/X, EJAE, AUDREY NUNA, REI AMI, KPop Demon Hunters Cast (Rank #1)\n2. A second track at Rank #2 (details were cut off in the tool output)\n\nThe data appears to be from a future date (2025-08-20), which suggests the tool may be using placeholder or test data rather than current charts.\n\n## 3. Lyrics for 'The Saltwater Room' by Owl City\nThe SoundCloud Scraper successfully retrieved the lyrics for \"The Saltwater Room\" by Owl City in LRC format (with timestamps). The lyrics are complete except for being cut off at the end. Key lyrics include:\n\n- \"Time together isn't ever quite enough / When you and I are alone / I've never felt so at home\"\n- \"What will it take to make or break this hint of love? / Only time, only time\"\n\nThe lyrics tell a story about two people spending time together by the shore and exploring their feelings.\n\n## 4. Information about Ludovico Einaudi's 'Experience' Album\nThe Spotify Web tool was used to retrieve album information, but there appears to be a mismatch in the data returned. Instead of Ludovico Einaudi's \"Experience\" album, the tool returned information about an album called \"Kan\" by an artist named UZI. This album was released on March 19, 2021, and contains 10 tracks. The first track is titled \"Makina\" with a duration of 211,016 ms (about 3:31). The tool output was cut off before showing all tracks.\n\n## 5. English-language Radio Stations Broadcasting from Japan\nThe 50K Radio Stations tool was used to search for English-language radio stations in Japan (country code 111), but returned no results. The response shows: \"success: True, has_next: False, total: 0, data: []\" indicating that no stations matching these criteria were found in the database.\n\n## 6. Lyrics for the Children's Song 'ABC'\nThe kjoller tool successfully retrieved the lyrics for the children's song \"ABC\". The lyrics are simple and educational:\n\n\"a b c d e f g\nh i j k l m n o p\nq q r r s s t\nq q r r s s t\nu v x y z \u00e6 \u00f8 \u00e5\notte-og-tyve skal der st\u00e5\"\n\nThe song is tagged with \"bogstaver\" (Danish for \"letters\") and appears to be a Danish alphabet song, as it includes the Danish letters \u00e6, \u00f8, and \u00e5.\n\n## 7. Information about Coldplay's 'Viva La Vida' Track\nThe Spotify tool was used to retrieve track information, but there appears to be a mismatch in the data returned. Instead of Coldplay's \"Viva La Vida,\" the tool returned information about a track called \"In Control (feat. Selin)\" by Mahmut Orhan, Ali Arutan, and Selin. This track was released on October 30, 2020, has a duration of 179,232 ms (about 2:59), and is not marked as explicit. The tool output was cut off before showing complete details.\n\n## Summary\nFor your global music festival, I was able to provide:\n- Partial lyrics for \"The Saltwater Room\" by Owl City\n- Lyrics for the children's song \"ABC\" (in Danish)\n- Limited information about the top 2 songs in the USA\n\nHowever, several requests encountered issues:\n- No classical music playlists were returned from SoundCloud\n- No English-language radio stations broadcasting from Japan were found\n- The album information for Ludovico Einaudi's \"Experience\" returned incorrect data\n- The track information for Coldplay's \"Viva La Vida\" returned incorrect data\n\nYou may need to try alternative tools or sources to gather the missing or incorrect information for your global music festival.",

Top Trending YouTube Music Videos in South Korea\nUnfortunately, the YouTube trending API call for South Korea did not return any data. This is a limitation in the current data collection that needs to be addressed.\n\n## 2. Random Radio Stations from Around the World\nThe attempt to collect random radio stations encountered an error (HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error). This indicates a server-side issue with the Radio World API that prevented retrieval of random stations.\n\n## 3. Popular Songs from Current Pop Charts\nThe Genius Chart API call for pop songs also returned an error (HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error). This prevented access to current pop chart information.\n\n## 4. Children's Songs by Composer 'Bellman'\nThe kjoller API successfully returned one children's song by C.M. Bellman:\n\n- **Title**: Bj\u00f8rnen sover\n- **Melody**: C.M. Bellman\n- **Tags**: klasiker, dyr\n- **Lyrics**: The song is about a sleeping bear and includes lyrics in what appears to be Danish\n\nNote that this is a limited result with only one song returned, which may not represent Bellman's complete works.\n\n## 5. Song Suggestions Related to 'kiss the'\nThe Shazam auto-complete API successfully returned 10 song suggestions:\n\n1. kiss the girl\n2. kiss the rain\n3. kiss the girl ashley tisdale\n4. kiss the sky\n5. kiss them for me\n6. kiss the girl brent morgan\n7. kiss the crystal flake\n8. kiss the ring\n9. whos gonna kiss the brown haired girls\n10. kiss the tiger\n\n## 6. Albums by Artist with ID '52wBYviD0Fnactl1q7ibdT'\nThe Spotify API returned an empty result for this artist ID. The response indicates that there are 0 total albums available for this artist ID, which suggests either the artist ID is incorrect or the artist has no albums in the Spotify database.\n\n## 7. Featured Radio Stations for Homepage Display\nThe Radio World API returned a partial list of featured radio stations (the response was cut off). The stations retrieved include:\n\n1. **Jagaran FM 90.8** (Nepal)\n2. **GotRadio - Piano Perfect** (USA)\n3. **Metro 95.1** (Argentina)\n4. **Crimson-fm** (Germany)\n\nNote: The API response was truncated, so only 4 out of the requested 10 stations were visible in the results.\n\n## 8. Global Music Chart Rankings\nThe Shazam charts/track API call did not return any data, limiting our ability to provide global music chart rankings.\n\n## Summary\nYour music discovery platform data collection has yielded mixed results. We successfully gathered children's songs by Bellman (though limited to one song), song suggestions related to 'kiss the', and a partial list of featured radio stations. However, several critical components encountered errors or returned no data, including YouTube trends in South Korea, random radio stations, pop charts, artist albums, and global music charts. To create comprehensive curated playlists showcasing different music cultures and genres, you'll need to troubleshoot these API connections or explore alternative data sources to fill these gaps.",

    "final_answer": "# Music-Themed Party Playlist Recommendations\n\n## 1. Currently Trending Artists on Genius\nUnfortunately, the Genius tool returned an error (HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error), so I couldn't retrieve trending artists for your main stage. You might want to check Genius directly or consider using another source for trending artist information.\n\n## 2. Children's Songs with 'ABC' in the Title\nThe children's song database returned one result for your kids area:\n\n**Song: ABC**\n- Lyrics: \"a b c d e f g / h i j k l m n o p / q q r r s s t / q q r r s s t / u v x y z \u00e6 \u00f8 \u00e5 / otte-og-tyve skal der st\u00e5\"\n- Tagged as: \"bogstaver\" (letters)\n- This appears to be a simple alphabet song, perfect for a children's area.\n\n## 3. Indonesian Radio Stations from Jakarta\nThe radio stations tool returned no results for Jakarta, Indonesia (country_id: 63). This suggests either there are no stations in the database for this location or there might be an issue with the search parameters. You may need to try a different source for Indonesian radio stations.\n\n## 4. Songs Related to Coldplay's 'Yellow'\nThe YouTube Music API returned related content, but the results appear to be unrelated to Coldplay's 'Yellow'. Instead, the tool returned songs by German artists like Sido and Eko Fresh. This suggests there might have been an issue with the browse_id parameter used. The results are partial and don't address your request for the chill zone.\n\n## 5. Tracks by Ennio Morricone\nThe Music Links API returned several Ennio Morricone-related artists for your sophisticated lounge area:\n\n- Ennio Morricone (multiple entries)\n- Ennio Morricone Orchestra\n- Orchestra di Ennio Morricone\n- Ennio Morricone e i Cantori Moderni di Alessandroni\n\nRelated artists also included:\n- Piero Piccioni\n- Dario Marianelli\n- Andrea Morricone\n- Roma Sinfonietta\n\nNote that the tool only returned artist information, not specific tracks. You would need to search for individual songs by these artists.\n\n## 6. Songs Containing 'Summer Nights'\nThe Shazam auto-complete tool suggested the following terms:\n- \"summer nights\"\n- \"summer nights mid july\"\n- \"summer nights rascal flatts\"\n\nThese suggestions can help you find songs for your outdoor patio, but the tool didn't provide actual song details. You would need to search for these terms to find the complete tracks.\n\n## 7. Information about Taylor Swift's 'Lover'\nThe Spotify tool returned an error (\"Config Error!2 Please try again\") when trying to retrieve information about Taylor Swift's 'Lover' track. You'll need to find this information through another source for your romantic corner.\n\n## 8. Popular Party Tracks from YouTube Music\nThe YouTube Music API returned some party playlist suggestions:\n\n**Top Result:**\n- \"Best dance songs 2024 \ud83c\udf08 Party songs 2024 ~ Songs that make you dance\"\n- Duration: 1:04:30\n- Views: 5.5M\n- By: Love Life Lyrics\n\n**Additional Song:**\n- \"The Rock n Roll Jukebox Party Continuous Jumping & Jive Mix\"\n- From album: \"Ultimate Rock n Roll Party - The Very Best 50s & 60s Party Hits Ever\"\n- Duration: 45:19\n\nNote that the results were cut off, so there are likely more tracks available than what was shown.\n\n## Summary\nI've gathered partial information for your music-themed party, but several tools returned errors or incomplete results. You have options for children's songs, Ennio Morricone artists, summer night themes, and some party playlists. However, you'll need additional sources for trending artists, Indonesian radio stations, Coldplay-related songs, and Taylor Swift's 'Lover' track. Consider using direct music streaming platforms to fill these gaps in your party planning.",

K-pop Girl Groups\nThe K-POP girl-groups tool was queried for trending groups but returned no data (`{'status': 'success', 'message': 'Data fetched successfully', 'data': [], 'count': 0}`). This suggests either there were no matches for the specific query parameters used, or there might be an issue with the data source.\n\n## 2. K-pop Idols Information\nThe K-POP Idols tool successfully returned information about Jungkook from BTS:\n\n- **Stage Name**: Jungkook\n- **Full Name**: Jeon Jungkook\n- **Korean Name**: \uc804\uc815\uad6d\n- **Date of Birth**: September 1, 1997\n- **Group**: BTS\n- **Country**: South Korea\n- **Height**: 178 cm\n- **Weight**: 66 kg\n- **Birthplace**: Busan\n\nThis provides a profile of one of K-pop's most prominent idols, though it represents just one artist rather than a comprehensive list.\n\n## 3. Most Viewed Asian Music Videos on YouTube (24h)\nThe MusicData API returned the top Asian music videos on YouTube in the last 24 hours. The data shows strong representation from Indian music content:\n\n1. \"Aaj Ki Raat\" from Stree 2 - 4,503,437 views\n2. \"Shree Hanuman Chalisa\" - 2,329,835 views\n3. Another version of \"Aaj Ki Raat\" - 2,116,182 views\n4. \"Ruaa Ruaa\" from Fateh - 2,032,173 views\n5. \"Aayi Nai\" from Stree 2 - 1,893,816 views\n6. \"KISSIK\" from Pushpa 2 - 1,806,413 views\n7. Thai music video \"\u0e08\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e48\" - 1,565,605 views\n8. Hindi version of \"KISSIK\" - 1,468,617 views\n9. \"Angaaron\" from Pushpa 2 - 1,468,079 views\n\n*Note: The output appears to be truncated as it cuts off mid-response.*\n\n## 4. Shazam Song Count\nThe Shazam tool returned data for a single song with ID 40333609:\n- **Total Shazams**: 3,933,741\n\n*Note: The song title was not provided in the output, only its ID.*\n\n## 5. Hot Trending Songs on Twitter\nThe Billboard-API returned the \"HOT TRENDING SONGS POWERED BY TWITTER\" chart from November 6, 2021 (note this is historical data, not current):\n\n1. \"Butter\" by BTS (1 week at #1)\n2. \"Rock With You\" by SEVENTEEN (new entry)\n3. \"Permission To Dance\" by BTS (down from #1)\n4. \"Money\" by Lisa (down from #2)\n5. \"Lalisa\" by Lisa (down from #3)\n6. \"Savage\" by aespa (holding at #6)\n7. \"Spaceman\" by Mew Suppasit (new entry)\n8. \"Tamed-Dashed\" by ENHYPEN (down from #5)\n9. \"My Universe\" by Coldplay x BTS (down from #4)\n10. \"Dynamite\" by BTS (up from #12)\n\nThis chart shows strong K-pop dominance in social media trends, with BTS appearing three times in the top 10.\n\n## 6. Halsey Song Excerpt\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool returned a random song excerpt from her album \"Manic\" (released January 17, 2020):\n\n- **Song**: \"More\"\n- **Album**: \"Manic\"\n- **Artist**: Halsey\n- **Release Date**: January 17, 2020\n\nA portion of the lyrics was provided, including lines such as \"They told me once, nothing grows / When a house ain't a home\" and \"I sit and I stare at your clothes in the drawer / I cry and my knuckles get sore.\"\n\n## 7. Classical Albums on SoundCloud\nThe SoundCloud Scraper tool was queried for classical albums, but no output was provided in the results. This suggests either an error occurred or no data was returned.\n\n## 8. Popular International Radio Stations\nThe Radio World tool returned an error (HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error), so no information about international radio stations could be retrieved.\n\n## Summary\nYour global music discovery dashboard has partial data across different platforms and regions. The strongest data points are from YouTube's Asian music video trends (primarily Indian content), Twitter's trending songs (dominated by K-pop, though from 2021), and individual artist information (Jungkook from BTS and a Halsey song excerpt). Several tools returned limited or no data, including the K-pop girl groups search, SoundCloud classical albums, and international radio stations. To create a truly comprehensive dashboard, you would need to troubleshoot these data gaps or find alternative data sources for these categories.",

There's this song I heard at a caf\u00e9 with ID number 40333609 - I'm wondering how popular it is among people who use that music identification app. Also, I remember there was an interesting Twitter-based music chart from early November 2021 - what were people talking about musically back then? I'd love to discover some of Halsey's work too - perhaps a random piece of her artistry and which collection it belongs to. For my classical music appreciation, what collections might I find on that orange-logoed audio platform? And finally, for my international radio program, I'd like to explore a diverse selection of broadcasting stations from different corners of the world."

    "final_answer": "# Comprehensive Music Exploration Weekend Plan\n\n## 1. Billboard 200 Chart Data\nThe Billboard 200 chart data from November 1, 2023 shows:\n- #1: blink-182 - \"One More Time...\"\n- #2: Drake - \"For All The Dogs\"\n- #3: Rolling Stones - \"Hackney Diamonds\"\n- #4: Bad Bunny - \"Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va A Pasar Manana\"\n- #5: Morgan Wallen - \"One Thing At A Time\"\n\nNote that the tool returned only the top 5 entries from the Billboard 200 chart, so this is not the complete chart data.\n\n## 2. Trending Songs on Twitter\nThe tool for retrieving HOT TRENDING SONGS POWERED BY TWITTER returned an error message: \"Please check the endpoint address and parameters.\" The notice indicated that the Billboard-API is updated weekly and based on Saturday data. Unfortunately, no trending Twitter song data is available.\n\n## 3. Upcoming Concerts in the US\nThe Spotify Concerts tool returned partial information about one concert:\n- Event: Concert at RFK Stadium in Washington\n- Date: July 15, 2023 at 8:00 PM\n- Featured Artists: Lil Uzi Vert, Jazmine Sullivan, and multiple other artists\n\nThe tool output was cut off, so this is likely only one of many available concerts. Additionally, this concert appears to be from the past (July 2023), so it may not be relevant for your upcoming plans.\n\n## 4. New Music Releases in the US\nThe Spotify New Releases tool showed that Taylor Swift has a new album release in the US market. However, the tool output was cut off, so only the first release was visible. The data indicates this album is available in numerous markets including the US.\n\n## 5. Mood-Based Music Categories\nYouTube Music API returned comprehensive mood and genre categories:\n\nGenres (25 total):\n- African, Arabic, Blues, Bollywood & Indian, Classical\n- Country & Americana, Dance & Electronic, Decades, Family\n- Hip-Hop, Indie & Alternative, Jazz, K-Pop, Latin\n- Metal, Pop, R&B & Soul, Reggae & Caribbean, Rock\n- Seasons, Soundtracks & Musicals\n- Turkish Folk & Traditional, Turkish Hip-Hop, Turkish Pop\n\nMoods & Moments (7 total):\n- Chill, Commute, Energy Boosters, Feel Good\n- Focus, Party, Romance\n\nThese categories would be excellent for creating themed playlists.\n\n## 6. German Electronic Music Radio Stations\nThe 50K Radio Stations tool returned no results when searching for electronic music stations in Germany (country_id: 82). The response indicated 0 total stations found, which may indicate an issue with the search parameters or that the database doesn't have German electronic stations indexed properly.\n\n## 7. Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' on SoundCloud\nThe SoundCloud Scraper tool returned an error: \"HQ audio is not available to BASIC users. Please subscribe to a higher plan.\" No metadata or download links for Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' were provided.\n\n## 8. Radio Dosis Stream\nThe Emisora Radio Dosis tool returned binary data, which appears to be an audio stream. However, this data cannot be directly played in this text-based interface. You would need to use a compatible audio player to stream Radio Dosis content.\n\n## Summary\nFor your music exploration weekend, you have access to the current Billboard 200 chart (partial data), mood-based categories for playlist creation, and one new release from Taylor Swift. Unfortunately, several tools returned incomplete or error responses: no Twitter trending songs data, limited concert information, no German electronic radio stations, and no access to Ed Sheeran's track on SoundCloud. The Radio Dosis stream appears to be available but requires an audio player to access.",

I'm also wondering about live music - are there any notable concerts happening across the US right now? While we're at it, could you pull up the latest music releases in the US? I'd like to organize my playlists better, so what mood categories does YouTube Music offer? Also, I'm looking for some electronic music stations, specifically in country ID 82. Oh, and I've been trying to find Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' on SoundCloud - could you grab the metadata and a download link for that? One last thing - do you know if there's any way to listen to Radio Dosis Mix?",

I wonder which songs are generating the most buzz on social media right now? With concert season approaching, I'm wondering if there are any live shows happening across the country at the moment. Also, what fresh music has just dropped that I should check out? When I'm in different moods, what categories might YouTube Music suggest to match my feelings? I've been wanting to explore electronic music stations in Italy - are there any good ones? I absolutely love Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' and was hoping to find more details about that track on SoundCloud. And lastly, I've heard about this Radio Dosis Mix - is there a way I could tune into that?"

Unfortunately, several of the tools encountered issues, but I've compiled what information was successfully retrieved:\n\n## 1. Billboard Independent Albums Chart (US)\n**Tool Result: ERROR**\nThe Billboard API was unreachable. The system reported: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\" This means I couldn't retrieve the latest independent album releases in the US as requested.\n\n## 2. Trending YouTube Music Videos in South Korea\n**Tool Result: INCOMPLETE**\nThe MusicData API for YouTube trends in South Korea was called, but the output appears to be empty or not properly returned in the results.\n\n## 3. Current Top Artists on Genius\n**Tool Result: ERROR**\nThe Genius API returned an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error, meaning I couldn't retrieve the current top artists data.\n\n## 4. New Album Releases on Spotify (UK)\n**Tool Result: ERROR**\nThe Spotify New Releases API was unreachable. The system reported: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\"\n\n## 5. Song Suggestions Related to \"Summer Nights\"\n**Tool Result: SUCCESS**\nThe Shazam auto-complete tool returned the following suggestions related to \"summer nights\":\n- summer nights\n- summer nights mid july\n- summer nights rascal flatts\n\nThese suggestions could be used as starting points for playlist creation around this theme.\n\n## 6. Ludovico Einaudi on SoundCloud\n**Tool Result: PARTIAL SUCCESS**\nThe SoundCloud search returned information about Ludovico Einaudi's profile:\n- **Name**: Ludovico Einaudi\n- **Profile URL**: https://soundcloud.com/ludovicoeinaudi\n- **Created**: May 25, 2011\n- **Last Modified**: December 4, 2023\n- **Description**: \"Ludovico Einaudi is known the world over through films and TV. His music has featured in titles including Black Swan, Doctor Zhivago, This is England and many more...\"\n- **Location**: Turin, Italy\n- **Followers**: 2,063,385\n- **Tracks**: 579\n- **Playlists**: 90\n- **Verified**: Yes\n\nNote: The output was cut off, so there may be additional information that wasn't returned.\n\n## 7. 45-Minute Extended Piano Piece\n**Tool Result: PARTIAL**\nThe Miza song extension tool was used to create a 45-minute extended version of a YouTube piano piece (URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgOci6JXPIc), but the output appears to be binary data (likely an image or audio file) that can't be displayed in text format.\n\n## 8. Taylor Swift's \"Folklore\" Album Information\n**Tool Result: INCORRECT DATA**\nThe Spotify Web API returned information for an album called \"Kan\" by artist \"UZI\" instead of Taylor Swift's \"Folklore\". This appears to be due to using an incorrect album ID (3IBcauSj5M2A6lTeffJzdv) that doesn't correspond to \"Folklore\".\n\n## Summary\nUnfortunately, most of the data collection attempts encountered errors or returned incomplete information. Only the Shazam song suggestions and partial SoundCloud information for Ludovico Einaudi were successfully retrieved. To build your comprehensive global music discovery dashboard, you would need to retry these API calls or explore alternative data sources to gather the complete dataset you're looking for.",

    "hard_rewrite": "I've been exploring music trends lately and wondering what's happening in the independent scene from early December. Also curious about what videos are gaining popularity in that country known for K-pop. Who's been making waves on Genius this week? I'm putting together a playlist and need fresh UK releases. Something about those warm evenings under the stars would fit the mood perfectly - any suggestions? I'm looking for that Italian pianist with the minimalist compositions on SoundCloud. I found this beautiful ambient piece on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgOci6JXPIc) but need a shorter version for my meditation session - about 45 minutes would be perfect as an MP3. Oh, and there's this album with the code '3IBcauSj5M2A6lTeffJzdv' I heard about - what can you tell me about it?"

Spotify's Current Global Top 200 Songs\n\nThe Spotify_v3 tool returned partial information about the current global top songs:\n\n1. \"Golden\" by HUNTR/X, EJAE, AUDREY NUNA, REI AMI, KPop Demon Hunters Cast - 7,780,435 streams\n2. Unknown song (data cut off) - 5,552,656 streams\n\n**Limitation:** The response was significantly cut off, only showing the #1 song completely and partial information for the #2 song. The data appears to be from a future date (2025-08-20), which suggests this may be test data rather than actual current rankings.\n\n## 6. Most Popular SoundCloud Playlists Featuring Classical Music\n\nThe SoundCloud Scraper returned information about classical music playlists:\n\n- Found 23,185 total playlists matching \"classical music\"\n- Top result: \"Classical Music\" by Hasnaa Tabra\n  - 122 tracks, 14:20:29 duration\n  - 20,805 likes, 1,023 reposts\n  - Created on October 2, 2014\n\n**Limitation:** The tool only returned detailed information about one playlist, though it indicated there were 10 items in the response (the rest were cut off).\n\n## 7. Adele's '21' Album on Spotify\n\nThe Spotify_v3 Get Albums tool returned information about an album, but it was not Adele's '21' as requested. Instead, it returned information about Pitbull's \"Global Warming\" album:\n\n- Album: \"Global Warming\" by Pitbull\n- Release date: November 16, 2012\n- 18 tracks total\n\n**Limitation:** The wrong album ID was used in the request (4aawyAB9vmqN3uQ7FjRGTy), resulting in information about Pitbull's album instead of Adele's '21'.\n\n## 8. Halsey's 'Badlands (Deluxe Edition)' Album Details\n\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool returned basic information about the album:\n\n- Album: \"Badlands (Deluxe Edition)\" by Halsey\n- Release date: August 28, 2015\n- Contains 15 songs (only IDs provided, not titles)\n\n**Limitation:** While the album was correctly identified, only IDs were provided for the songs rather than their titles, limiting the usefulness of this information.\n\n## 9. Dua Lipa's 'Levitating' Shazam Count\n\nThe Shazam tool successfully returned the number of times \"Levitating\" has been Shazamed:\n\n- Song ID: 40333609\n- Total Shazams: 3,933,741\n\n## Summary\n\nYour music analysis project has yielded mixed results. While some data was successfully retrieved (YouTube views from 2017, Shazam counts for \"Levitating\", basic information about Halsey's \"Badlands\"), several requests encountered limitations or errors. The Billboard data was completely unavailable due to a connection error, and many of the other responses were incomplete or cut off. Additionally, the Spotify album request returned the wrong album. To complete your comprehensive analysis, you would need to make additional requests with corrected parameters to fill in the missing data.",

Here's what I found across different platforms and regions:\n\n## 1. Billboard's All-Time Greatest Artists\n\nUnfortunately, the Billboard API tool returned an error when attempting to retrieve the Greatest of All Time Artists chart. The specific error was a host not found error (ENOTFOUND), indicating connectivity issues with Billboard's database server. This information is currently unavailable through this tool.\n\n## 2. Most Viewed Vietnamese Artists on YouTube\n\nThe MusicData API successfully returned the top Vietnamese music videos on YouTube:\n\n| Ranking | Video Title | Views | Daily Views |\n|---------|-------------|-------|------------|\n| 1 | 365DABAND - B\u1ed0NG B\u1ed0NG BANG BANG | 572,309,145 | 77,951 |\n| 2 | B\u1ed1ng B\u1ed1ng Bang Bang - B\u00e9 B\u00e0o Ng\u01b0 | 548,818,757 | 201,475 |\n| 3 | Th\u01b0\u01a1ng L\u1eafm Th\u1ea7y C\u00f4 \u01a0i! - B\u00e9 Phan Hi\u1ebfu Ki\u00ean | 483,898,676 | 41,652 |\n| 4 | X\u00daC X\u1eaeC X\u00daC X\u1eba - B\u00c9 B\u1ea2O AN ft PHI LONG | 427,688,391 | 7,897 |\n| 5 | S\u00d3NG GI\u00d3 - K-ICM x JACK | 424,762,083 | 58,402 |\n\nNotable artists include 365DABAND, K-ICM, JACK, and S\u01a1n T\u00f9ng M-TP. Children's content appears particularly popular, with several videos featuring child performers.\n\n*Note: The response was truncated and only provided the top 12 entries (partially).*\n\n## 3. Halsey's Discography\n\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool provided detailed album information:\n\n### Albums:\n- **Room 93** (2014)\n- **Badlands (Deluxe Edition)** (2015) - 15 songs\n- **Hopeless Fountain Kingdom (Deluxe)** (2017) - 14 songs\n- **Manic** (2020) - 15 songs\n- **If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power** (2021) - *Note: The song list was truncated*\n\n*Note: The API response was cut off mid-response, so the complete discography information may not be available.*\n\n## 4. Top Featured Artists on YouTube (2022)\n\nThe MusicData API provided the top artists on YouTube for 2022:\n\n| Ranking | Artist | Views |\n|---------|--------|-------|\n| 1 | Bad Bunny | 10,046,995,039 |\n| 2 | Blackpink | 4,726,453,501 |\n| 3 | BTS | 4,719,656,705 |\n| 4 | Karol G | 4,164,397,009 |\n| 5 | Anuel AA | 3,626,724,216 |\n\nLatin artists dominated the top positions, with Bad Bunny having more than double the views of the second-place artist. K-pop groups (Blackpink and BTS) also showed strong global presence.\n\n*Note: The response was truncated and only provided the top 30 entries (partially).*\n\n## 5. Spotify Track Information\n\nThe Spotify API returned information about track ID '4WNcduiCmDNfmTEz7JvmLv':\n\nThe track is \"In Control (feat. Selin)\" by Mahmut Orhan and Ali Arutan featuring Selin. It was released on October 30, 2020, as a single.\n\n*Note: The response was truncated and didn't include complete track details.*\n\n## 6. Emisora Radio Dosis\n\nThe tool for streaming Emisora Radio Dosis returned an empty response. It appears this tool may require actual streaming capabilities that aren't available in this text-based format.\n\n## 7. YouTube Music Search Results for \"BTS\"\n\nThe YouTube Music API returned search results for BTS:\n\n- **Top result**: BTS (artist with 132M subscribers)\n- **Songs include**: \n  - \"MIC Drop (Steve Aoki Remix)\" (5:08)\n  - Other BTS songs (response was truncated)\n\n*Note: The response was truncated and didn't include the full search results.*\n\n## 8. Kooed Radio Stations Interface\n\nThe Kooed Radio Stations endpoint returned an empty response. Similar to the Emisora Radio tool, this may require interactive capabilities not available in this format.\n\n## 9. Random Song Excerpt from Halsey\n\nThe tool successfully returned a random song excerpt from Halsey's discography:\n\n**Song**: \"More\" from the album \"Manic\" (2020)\n\n**Excerpt**:\n\"They told me once, nothing grows\nWhen a house ain't a home\nIs it true, honestly\"\n\nThe song appears to be an emotional piece about longing and hope, with lyrics suggesting themes of waiting and desire.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis data provides insights into global music influence across different platforms and regions. We can observe:\n\n1. Strong regional preferences (Vietnamese content, Latin artists)\n2. Global reach of K-pop groups like BTS and Blackpink\n3. Diverse musical styles represented across platforms\n4. The evolution of an artist's work over time (Halsey's discography)\n\nSome limitations in the data include truncated responses and failed API calls, which prevent a truly comprehensive analysis.",

Additionally, get information about the top YouTube artists from 2022 who were featured in collaborations. I'd like details about a specific Spotify track with ID 4WNcduiCmDNfmTEz7JvmLv.

Also, I've been listening to that artist with blue hair who released 'Without Me' and 'Bad At Love' - what's her complete body of work like? Maybe share a taste of her lyrics? I'm also wondering which collaborative artists made the biggest splash on video platforms last year (2022). There's this one track with ID 4WNcduiCmDNfmTEz7JvmLv that I heard recently - what can you tell me about it? I've heard mentions of Radio Dosis Mix as a streaming option - any insights there? Oh, and that Korean group with the massive global following - what comes up when you search for them on music platforms?

The tool could not provide the current top 5 Spanish songs on the Billboard chart.\n\n## 2) Music Videos for Popular Spanish Artists\n**Genius - Song Lyrics: Videos Tool**\nThe tool returned an error indicating that a required parameter ('artist_id') was missing. Without specifying particular Spanish artists, the tool could not retrieve any music videos.\n\n## 3) Information about Spotify User 'spanishhits'\n**Spotify _v2: User details Tool**\nThe API was unreachable according to the error message. The tool could not connect to Spotify's servers to retrieve information about the 'spanishhits' user who curates Spanish music playlists.\n\n## 4) Song Suggestions Related to 'Bailando'\n**Shazam: auto-complete Tool**\nThe tool returned three suggestions related to 'bailando':\n- bailando bachata\n- bailando\n- bailando con julieta\n\nThese could be starting points for your festival playlist, though this is limited to search suggestions rather than actual song recommendations.\n\n## 5) Related Songs to 'Despacito'\n**Youtube Music API (Detailed): Get Song Related Tool**\nThe tool encountered an internal server error (500) and was unable to provide related songs to 'Despacito'.\n\n## 6) Spanish Radio Stations in Madrid\n**50K Radio Stations: Get Cities Tool**\nThe tool returned an empty data set with 'total: 0', suggesting either there are no radio stations matching the criteria in the database, or there was an issue with the search parameters.\n\n## 7) Details about Enrique Iglesias' Album 'Euphoria'\n**Spotify Web: Get albums Tool**\nThe tool returned a null value for the album, indicating it could not find information about Enrique Iglesias' 'Euphoria' album with the provided ID.\n\n## 8) Latin Music Radio Stations in Miami\n**Kooed: Kooed endpoint Tool**\nThe tool did not return any output, suggesting an error or limitation in retrieving information about Latin music radio stations in Miami.\n\n## 9) Curated Playlist of Reggaeton Hits\n**Miza: Playlist extraction Tool**\nThe tool returned a partial list of songs from a YouTube playlist, but these appear to be general popular music rather than reggaeton hits specifically. The returned songs include tracks by Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars, Tyla, Wizkid, Billie Eilish, Rene\u00e9 Rapp, Ed Sheeran, GIV\u0112ON, Benson Boone, and others. The output was cut off mid-response, so the complete playlist is not available.\n\n## Summary\nUnfortunately, most of the tools encountered errors or returned limited information. For your Spanish music festival planning, you may need to explore alternative sources to gather comprehensive information about Spanish music charts, artists, radio stations, and playlists. The few pieces of information obtained (Shazam suggestions for 'bailando' and a partial, non-reggaeton playlist) are insufficient for comprehensive festival planning.",

There's also this Spotify album (1FOMS0XZaXpxM3bMUjHvjU) that a friend recommended - what's the story behind it? Oh, and I found this interesting YouTube playlist that seems to be trending: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw-VjHDlEOgvtnnnqWlTqByAtC7tXBg6D - what gems does it contain?"

The singer and songwriter arrived in 2011 with three mixtapes offering morose ballads that seemed to have no designs on mainstream appeal. Within only a few years, however, Tesfaye had scored a variety of Top Ten pop hits. These included a duet with Ariana Grande (\u201cLove Me Harder\u201d), a dramatic ballad from the soundtrack of Fifty Shades of Grey (the Grammy-winning \u201cEarned It\u201d), a retro-contemporary disco-funk collaboration with Max Martin (\u201cI Can\u2019t Feel My Face\u201d), and a sleek Daft Punk production (\u201cStarboy\u201d). Additionally, Tesfaye topped the Billboard 200 with his second and third proper full-lengths, Beauty Behind the Madness (2015) and Starboy (2016), which also made him a two-time winner of the Grammy for Best Urban Contemporary Album. Tesfaye entered the next decade with After Hours (2020), the chart-topping source of the global smash \u201cBlinding Lights,\u201d and followed up with Dawn FM (2022). He ventured into acting and television production in 2023 as the co-writer, executive producer, and general conceptual force behind the HBO series The Idol. Music for the show naturally included exclusive tracks from the Weeknd, as well as contributions from Madonna, Playboi Carti, MIKE DEAN, and others. \\nBorn in Toronto to Ethiopian immigrants, Abel Tesfaye debuted the Weeknd in late 2010 with three songs uploaded to YouTube. Made with producer Jeremy Rose, they served as a low-key prelude to three mixtapes self-released as free digital downloads the following year. The first one was House of Balloons (March), where clear traces of radio-friendly contemporary R&amp;B \u00e0 la Trey Songz, Jeremih, the-Dream, and Drake were synthesized with the progressive left-of-center likes of Spacek and Sa-Ra.

I keep thinking about a melody that reminds me of warm evenings at the beach - what might Shazam suggest if I typed those words? I'm looking for something more contemplative - perhaps that Italian pianist who does minimalist classical pieces has something on SoundCloud? Sometimes I just want to tune into something continuous without interruption - is there a station that offers that? I'm intrigued by that Canadian artist with all the chart-topping hits - what information could I find if I had his Spotify profile? That catchy Latin song that was everywhere a few years ago - is it still discoverable across platforms? Finally, there's this haunting female vocal track with a distinctive beat - if I knew its YouTube code, what details could I learn about it?"

I'm planning a global radio listening tour - which nations could I tune into? I'm particularly interested in those timeless albums that maintain popularity despite not being new releases - what was charting in that category last June? Also, which collections were people streaming worldwide? For my playlist, I'd love to include something unexpected from that artist who sang 'Without Me' - surprise me!

I wonder what's currently trending when someone opens Spotify in the States. Which videos captivated YouTube audiences last year? I've been hearing a lot about this K-pop performer - Park something? The one in that famous boy group. And speaking of artists, there's this powerful Halsey song about someone taking advantage - what are the exact words again? Actually, I'd love to explore more of her catalog too. Also, my friend recommended an artist with this strange Spotify code (26VFTg2z8YR0cCuwLzESi2) - who might I enjoy if I like their style? I'm also interested in finding some electronic music collections on SoundCloud, but not too many results please. Oh, and could you help me access that media file I saved earlier with the reference code 'ABCDEF'?"

    "final_answer": "# Music Discovery Project Data Analysis\n\n## 1. Artists Related to The Weeknd on Spotify\n\nUsing the Spotify API, I retrieved artists related to The Weeknd to understand his musical ecosystem. The tool returned information about several related artists, though the output appears to be truncated and doesn't show the complete list. From what was returned, here are the related artists:\n\n- **PARTYNEXTDOOR**\n  - Genres: R&B, rap, Toronto rap, urban contemporary\n  - Popularity score: 76/100\n  - Followers: 5,385,536\n\n- **Brent Faiyaz**\n  - Genres: R&B, rap\n  - Popularity score: 81/100\n  - Followers: 4,119,305\n\n- **Bryson Tiller**\n  - Genres: Kentucky hip hop, R&B, rap\n  - Followers: 7,160,955\n\nThe data suggests The Weeknd's musical ecosystem primarily consists of R&B and rap artists, with strong connections to the Toronto sound (as seen with PARTYNEXTDOOR).\n\n**Limitation**: The tool output was truncated, so this is only a partial list of related artists. A complete analysis would require the full dataset.\n\n## 2. Billboard Artist 100 Chart Analysis\n\nI retrieved the Billboard Artist 100 chart to see trending artists. The data appears to be from May 15, 2023. Here are the top artists from the chart:\n\n1. **Ed Sheeran** (maintained #1 position from previous week)\n2. **Taylor Swift** (moved from #1 to #2)\n3. **Morgan Wallen** (moved from #1 to #3)\n4. **Luke Combs** (moved from #1 to #4)\n5. **SZA** (moved from #1 to #5)\n6. **LE SSERAFIM** (maintained #6 position)\n7. **Drake** (moved from #1 to #7)\n\n**Limitation**: The output was truncated, showing only the top 7 artists rather than the full Artist 100 chart. Additionally, some data fields like 'weeks_on_chart' appear to be empty, and the 'peak_position' values seem unusual (showing numbers greater than 100 in some cases).\n\n## 3. Billie Eilish's 'Bad Guy' Lyrics Analysis\n\nI successfully retrieved the lyrics for Billie Eilish's 'Bad Guy' in LRC format (with timestamps). The lyrics reveal several key themes in her songwriting style:\n\n- **Role reversal and power dynamics**: Lines like \"I like it when you take control\" contrasted with \"I'm the bad guy\"\n- **Provocative themes**: References to seduction and rebellion\n- **Generational contrast**: \"My mommy likes to sing along with me / But she won't sing this song / If she reads all the lyrics\"\n- **Identity exploration**: Embracing the anti-hero persona throughout the song\n\nThe lyrics demonstrate Eilish's distinctive approach to songwriting, embracing darker themes and subverting traditional pop narratives.\n\n## Summary\n\nComparing these different perspectives on current music trends reveals:\n\n1. R&B and rap continue to be dominant genres, with artists like The Weeknd and his contemporaries maintaining strong popularity.\n\n2. The Billboard chart shows a diverse mix of pop (Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift), country (Morgan Wallen, Luke Combs), R&B (SZA), K-pop (LE SSERAFIM), and rap (Drake) dominating the mainstream.\n\n3. Billie Eilish's songwriting represents a newer trend in pop music that embraces darker themes, subversive lyrics, and a more authentic, less polished aesthetic that contrasts with traditional pop formulas.\n\nThese three data sources together provide a multi-dimensional view of the current music landscape, showing both mainstream commercial success and artistic innovation across different genres and platforms.",

Mar\u00edlia Mendon\u00e7a - 2,783,107,549 views\n\nThis data shows a strong presence of Latin artists and K-pop groups dominating YouTube viewership in 2020, with BTS leading by a significant margin.\n\n## Billboard Artist 100 (March 15, 2020)\n\nThe Billboard Artist 100 data for March 15, 2020 shows the following top artists (note: the data appears to be truncated after the 7th entry):\n\n1. Lil Uzi Vert (peak position: 1, weeks on chart: 125)\n2. NCT 127 (peak position: 2, weeks on chart: 9)\n3. Jhene Aiko (peak position: 3, weeks on chart: 16)\n4. BTS (peak position: 1, weeks on chart: 179)\n5. Post Malone (peak position: 1, weeks on chart: 194)\n6. Lil Baby (peak position: 1, weeks on chart: 96)\n7.

The data shows:\n\n- The song is available on YouTube Music\n- It's available in numerous countries worldwide (the API returned a long list of country codes)\n\n**Limitation:** The detailed information about the song such as release date, view count, chart positions, and other metrics was not fully provided in the API response or was truncated.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe 2020 music industry data shows BTS dominating YouTube with over 6.3 billion views, while also maintaining a strong position (#4) on the Billboard Artist 100 chart in March 2020. Latin artists like Bad Bunny, J Balvin, and Ozuna had exceptional YouTube performance. The Billboard chart from March 2020 shows a different landscape with Lil Uzi Vert, NCT 127, and Jhene Aiko in the top positions. Unfortunately, data about all-time popular artists on Genius could not be retrieved due to an API error, and the detailed information about BTS's \"Dynamite\" was incomplete in the provided results.",

This suggests either there are no stations indexed in their database for Jakarta or there might be an issue with the search parameters.\n\n2) **Latest Music Videos from Genius**: The Genius tool returned an error indicating missing required parameters - specifically an artist_id is needed. Without specifying particular artists, this tool couldn't provide any music video recommendations.\n\n3) **Spotify Search for 'Indonesian Traditional Music'**: The Spotify search tool appears to have been executed, but no output was provided in the results. This is a significant gap in the information needed for your themed playlist.\n\n4) **YouTube Playlist Extraction**: The Miza playlist extraction tool successfully retrieved songs from the provided YouTube playlist, but the results don't appear to be Indonesian pop songs as expected. Instead, the playlist contains various songs including:\n   - Pearl & The Oysters - Vitamin D\n   - My Baby Grand\n   - JoJo's Bizarre Adventure OST\n   - JOYWAVE - Rearranged\n   - Feng Suave - People Wither\n   - Several Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom soundtrack pieces\n   - Billie Holiday - I'll Be Seeing You\n   \nThe playlist appears to be a mix of indie music, video game soundtracks, and classic jazz rather than Indonesian pop music as suggested by the playlist title.\n\nTo properly plan your music-themed weekend focused on Indonesian music, you would need additional searches with more specific parameters for radio stations, artist-specific searches on Genius, complete results from Spotify, and a correctly labeled Indonesian pop music playlist.",

BTS and BLACKPINK demonstrate K-pop's global impact with multiple entries in the top 10.\n\n2. **Fastest to 1B Views:** None of the 2020 videos appear in the all-time fastest to reach 1 billion views list, suggesting that the record-breaking velocity videos are from earlier years. Adele's \"Hello\" remains the fastest at just 87.4 days.\n\n3. **German Market:** The German music scene appears diverse with local artists like AYLIVA and Apache 207 competing with international acts like Linkin Park. Apache 207 is the only artist showing an upward trend among the visible top artists.\n\n4. **Billie Eilish:** With over 83 million Spotify followers and a high popularity score of 86/100, Billie Eilish remains a significant global artist. Her genre classification as \"art pop\" and \"electropop\" positions her as a distinctive voice in contemporary pop music.\n\nThis data provides a solid foundation for analyzing how 2020's viral hits compare with all-time fastest-growing videos, current German trends, and Billie Eilish's significant market position.",

    "final_answer": "# Music Presentation Information\n\n## 1. Halsey's Song 'Without Me' Lyrics\n\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool provided selected portions of the lyrics for 'Without Me'. Here are some key excerpts:\n\n- Opening lines: \"Found you when your heart was broke / I filled your cup until it overflowed\"\n- Chorus: \"Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there? / Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me\"\n- Recurring theme: \"You know I'm the one who put you up there / Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?\"\n\nThe lyrics tell a story of someone who helped another person through difficult times, only to be taken advantage of once that person achieved success. The song expresses feelings of betrayal and questions the other person's actions.\n\n**Note:** The tool provided selected snippets rather than the complete lyrics.\n\n## 2. BTS Member Jungkook's Profile Details\n\nThe K-POP: Idols tool returned the following information about Jungkook:\n\n- **Full Name:** Jeon Jungkook (Korean: \uc804\uc815\uad6d)\n- **Stage Name:** Jungkook (Korean: \uc815\uad6d)\n- **Date of Birth:** September 1, 1997\n- **Group:** BTS\n- **Country:** South Korea\n- **Height:** 178 cm\n- **Weight:** 66 kg\n- **Birthplace:** Busan\n- **Gender:** Male\n\n## 3. Taylor Swift's 'Lover' Album Information\n\nThe Spotify_v3 tool provided these details about the 'Lover' album:\n\n- **Album Type:** Album\n- **Total Tracks:** 18\n- **Release Date:** August 23, 2019\n- **Cover Art:** Available in three resolutions (largest: 640x640)\n\n**Note:** The tool response appears to have been cut off, as it doesn't include the full list of tracks or complete album details.\n\n## 4. Songs Related to The Weeknd's 'Blinding Lights'\n\nUnfortunately, the Youtube Music API tool returned a 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to retrieve information about songs related to 'Blinding Lights'. The server was either overloaded or encountered an application error, so this information is not available.\n\n## 5. Spotify User 'spotify' Profile Details\n\nThe Spotify_v2 tool provided these details about the official Spotify user account:\n\n- **Display Name:** Spotify\n- **Profile URL:** https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify\n- **Profile Images:** Available in two sizes (64x64 and 300x300)\n- **Followers:** 12,444,994\n- **User Type:** user\n- **Spotify URI:** spotify:user:spotify\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your music presentation comparing different genres and artists, I've gathered information about Halsey's lyrics, Jungkook's profile, Taylor Swift's album, and Spotify's user profile. Unfortunately, information about songs related to The Weeknd's 'Blinding Lights' is unavailable due to a server error. Additionally, some of the information (particularly for Taylor Swift's album) is incomplete as the API response was truncated. You may want to supplement this information with additional research for a more comprehensive presentation.",

    "final_answer": "# Global Music Trends Report Analysis\n\n## 1. US Catalog Albums Chart\n\nThe Billboard API provided the US Catalog Albums chart for the week of October 8, 2022 (not current data). The top 5 catalog albums were:\n\n1. \"Dirt\" by Alice In Chains (30 weeks on chart)\n2. \"Starboy\" by The Weeknd (109 weeks on chart)\n3. \"Ctrl\" by SZA (192 weeks on chart)\n4. \"Greatest Hits\" by Queen (841 weeks on chart)\n5. \"Curtain Call: The Hits\" by Eminem (470 weeks on chart)\n\n**Limitation:** The data is from October 2022, not current, and the API response was cut off after the 8th entry, so we don't have the complete chart.\n\n## 2. Most Viewed Spanish Music Videos on YouTube (Last 24 Hours)\n\nThe MusicData API provided the following top Spanish music videos on YouTube in the last 24 hours:\n\n1. \"KAROL G - Si Antes Te Hubiera Conocido | Coke Studio\" (2,836,606 views)\n2. \"LA PATRULLA\" - Peso Pluma, Neton Vega (1,328,944 views)\n3. \"Grupo Frontera x Grupo Firme - EL AMOR DE SU VIDA\" (1,264,882 views)\n4. \"El Chombo, Dancing Green Alien - Dame Tu Cosita feat. Cutty Ranks\" (1,138,050 views)\n5. \"BLESSD \u274c OVY ON THE DRUMS - M\u00cdRAME\" (1,039,067 views)\n\n**Limitation:** The API response was cut off after the 11th entry, so we don't have the complete list.\n\n## 3. Countries Available for Radio Station Browsing\n\nThe Radio World API returned a list of countries with their respective number of radio stations. Some examples include:\n\n- Afghanistan (10 stations)\n- Albania (54 stations)\n- Algeria (77 stations)\n- Argentina (2,439 stations)\n- Australia (number not shown in the truncated response)\n\n**Limitation:** The API response was cut off after listing only 10-12 countries, despite indicating there are 219 total countries available. The response was paginated with 500 results per page, but we only received a partial list.\n\n## 4. Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' Track on SoundCloud\n\nThe SoundCloud Scraper tool returned an error: \"HQ audio is not available to BASIC users. Please subscribe to a higher plan.\"\n\n**Limitation:** The tool was unable to provide any metadata or download links for Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' due to subscription limitations.\n\n## 5. Top Songs in Spain (Early May 2022)\n\nThe Billboard-API for Spain Songs returned an error: \"This endpoint is available on the Ultra plan and above. If you want to access this endpoint, please upgrade your plan.\"\n\n**Limitation:** The tool was unable to provide any historical data for Spain's top songs from May 2022 due to subscription limitations.\n\n## Summary\n\nI was able to provide partial information for your global music trends report, specifically some data on US catalog albums (though from 2022) and current Spanish music videos trending on YouTube. However, I could only provide a very limited list of countries for radio browsing, and was unable to access information about Ed Sheeran's track on SoundCloud or historical Spanish chart data due to subscription limitations with the tools.

    "final_answer": "# K-pop Party Planning Information\n\n## 1. BTS Member Jungkook Information\n\nThe K-POP Idols tool provided the following details about Jungkook for your event program:\n\n- **Full Name**: Jeon Jungkook\n- **Korean Name**: \uc804\uc815\uad6d (Stage Name in Korean: \uc815\uad6d)\n- **Date of Birth**: September 1, 1997\n- **Group**: BTS\n- **Country**: South Korea\n- **Height**: 178 cm\n- **Weight**: 66 kg\n- **Birthplace**: Busan\n- **Gender**: Male\n\n## 2. Song Suggestions with 'love you' Phrase\n\nThe Shazam auto-complete tool returned only three suggestions containing the phrase 'love you':\n\n- \"love you down\"\n- \"love yourself\"\n- \"love you like a love song\"\n\n**Limitation**: This tool only provided song title suggestions, not complete songs or artists. For a comprehensive playlist, you would need additional searches with more specific terms or use another tool to get full song details.\n\n## 3. YouTube Playlist Extraction\n\nThe Miza Playlist extraction tool provided the following songs from your YouTube playlist (note: the output was truncated):\n\n1. Pearl & The Oysters \u274d Vitamin D (3:24)\n2. My Baby Grand (2:44)\n3. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure OST - Pillar Men Theme\u300eAwaken\u300f(3:55)\n4. JOYWAVE - Rearranged (2:59)\n5. Feng Suave - People Wither (Official Audio) (5:12)\n6. Gloom Spawn [Gloom Hands] | The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom OST (1:18)\n7. Gleeok Battle (All Phases) - The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (OST) (3:52)\n8. Colgera Battle - The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom OST (5:18)\n9. Hummingbird (5:20)\n10.

Revvin' My Cj7 (2:49)\n\n**Limitation**: The output was cut off, so there may be additional songs in the playlist that weren't included in the results.\n\n## 4. Spotify User 'cruilla' Public Playlists\n\nThe Spotify tool returned that user 'cruilla' has 0 public playlists available:\n\n```\n{'href': 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/cruilla/playlists?offset=0&limit=0', 'limit': 0, 'next': None, 'offset': 0, 'previous': None, 'total': 0, 'items': []}\n```\n\nThis means either the user doesn't have any public playlists or the username might be incorrect.\n\n## 5. YouTube Music Watch Playlist\n\nThe YouTube Music API returned the following recommended tracks for the video ID '1A7Qw88As64' (Eko Fresh - Aber):\n\n1. \"Aber\" by Eko Fresh (5:32)\n2. A song by Kool Savas featuring Nessi from the album \"KKS\" (3:04)\n\n**Limitation**: The output was truncated, so there are likely more recommended songs that weren't included in the results.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your K-pop themed party, you now have:\n- Detailed information about BTS member Jungkook for your event program\n- A few song title suggestions containing \"love you\" for your romantic segment\n- A partial list of songs from your YouTube playlist (which appears to be more diverse than strictly K-pop)\n- Information that Spotify user 'cruilla' has no public playlists\n- A partial list of songs recommended based on the YouTube Music video you provided\n\nTo complete your party planning, you might want to search for more K-pop specific songs containing romantic themes and expand your playlist with more BTS and other K-pop group tracks.",

    "final_answer": "# Indonesian Music Trends Report Analysis\n\n## 1. Top 10 Indonesian Songs from May 2022\nUnfortunately, I couldn't retrieve the top 10 Indonesian songs from May 2022. The Billboard-API tool returned an error message indicating that this endpoint is only available on the Ultra plan and above. Without an upgraded plan, this data remains inaccessible.\n\n## 2. Artist Information: Tulus\nThere appears to be a discrepancy in the artist ID provided. The ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8' actually belongs to INNA, not Tulus. Here's the information retrieved about INNA:\n\n- **Name**: INNA\n- **Popularity Score**: 72/100\n- **Followers**: 1,327,305\n- **Genres**: Dance pop, Romanian house, Romanian pop\n- **Spotify URL**: https://open.spotify.com/artist/2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8\n- **Images**: Three profile images available at different resolutions (640x640, 320x320, 160x160)\n\nThis information indicates that INNA is a popular Romanian artist rather than an Indonesian artist named Tulus.\n\n## 3. Playlists by Music Critic 'cruilla'\nThe search for playlists curated by 'cruilla' returned no results. According to the Spotify API response, this user either has no public playlists or the user ID might be incorrect. The total count of playlists returned was 0.\n\n## 4. Song Details: 'Hati-Hati di Jalan'\nThere appears to be another discrepancy. The song key '40333609' actually corresponds to \"River Flows In You\" by Yiruma, not \"Hati-Hati di Jalan\". Here's the information about the song that was retrieved:\n\n- **Title**: River Flows In You\n- **Artist**: Yiruma\n- **Type**: MUSIC\n- **Shazam Key**: 40333609\n- **Cover Art**: Available at multiple resolutions\n- **Share Links**: Available for various platforms including Twitter and Snapchat\n\nNote that the Shazam API response appears to be truncated, so some additional details about the song may be missing.\n\n## 5. Album Artwork File\nThe file retrieval attempt was successful and returned binary image data (JPEG format). However, I can only see the beginning portion of the binary data, which starts with the JFIF header indicating it's a JPEG image. The complete file content is not fully displayed in the tool output, but the retrieval itself appears to have worked.\n\n## Summary\nYour request for a comprehensive Indonesian music report faced several challenges:\n\n1. The Billboard chart data requires a plan upgrade to access\n2. The artist ID provided was for INNA (Romanian artist), not Tulus\n3. No playlists were found for user 'cruilla'\n4. The song key provided was for \"River Flows In You\" by Yiruma, not \"Hati-Hati di Jalan\"\n5. While the album artwork file was retrieved, only partial binary data is visible in the output\n\nTo create an accurate Indonesian music trends report, you would need to correct these discrepancies and possibly upgrade service plans to access the Billboard chart data.",

Then I wanted more information about a specific artist with Spotify ID 2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8. I also browsed through the public playlists of a Spotify user named 'cruilla'. To get more detailed information about a particular song, I used Shazam to look up song details for track #40333609, specifically requesting the information in Indonesian locale. Finally, I retrieved a media file with path 'ABCDEF' to access previously processed audio content.",

There's also a specific song I heard - can you look up the details for track #40333609 on Shazam? I'd prefer the information in Indonesian if possible.

    "hard_rewrite": "I've been exploring the musical landscape of Indonesia lately. I stumbled upon some interesting chart rankings from early May 2022 and was particularly drawn to the artist who goes by INNA - quite popular with over a million followers from what I understand. While browsing, I also checked what playlists a user named 'cruilla' has curated. There's this beautiful piano piece called 'River Flows In You' that I wanted to learn more about - I believe it's track #40333609, and I'd prefer to read about it in Bahasa Indonesia since I'm practicing the language. I also had some audio content saved somewhere under path 'ABCDEF' that I'd like to access again to continue my research."

Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' Track Details from SoundCloud\nThe SoundCloud Scraper tool returned an error: \"HQ audio is not available to BASIC users. Please subscribe to a higher plan.\" Unfortunately, no track details or download options were provided.\n\n## 3. Top 10 Genius Platform Contributors\nThe Genius Leaderboard tool returned partial data. Only two contributors were fully visible in the results:\n\n1. **resonare** - Attribution value: 39,233.8, Role: Editor, IQ: 681,526\n2. **Alexander/Alex** - Attribution value: 28,063 (Partial information only)\n\nThe data appears to be truncated, as we only received complete information for the first contributor and partial information for the second one.\n\n## 4. Popular Radio Stations in France\nThe Radio World tool returned no results for the query. While the tool executed successfully (status: \"ok\"), it appears there was an issue with the country ID parameter. The country ID \"73\" corresponds to \"Reunion Island\" (not mainland France), and the tool reported \"total_radios: 0\" for this region.\n\n## 5. Taylor Swift's 'Midnights' Album on Spotify\nThe Spotify Search tool successfully found Taylor Swift's Midnights album with several editions available:\n\n1. \"Midnights (The Til Dawn Edition)\" - Released in 2023\n2. \"Midnights\" - Released in 2022\n3. \"Midnights (3am Edition)\" - (Release year not fully visible in the data)\n\nThe search returned partial results, showing only 3 out of 5 requested albums, and the data for the third album appears to be truncated.\n\n## 6. Playlists from Spotify User 'cruilla'\nThe Spotify User Playlists tool successfully executed but returned no playlists for the user 'cruilla'. The response indicates that this user either has no public playlists or the user ID may not exist (total: 0, items: []).\n\n## Summary\nFor your music-themed party, you now have information about trending YouTube music videos from 2022, which could be featured as visual content. However, several aspects of your request encountered limitations: the SoundCloud download failed due to subscription restrictions, the Genius contributor list was incomplete, the France radio station search returned no results due to incorrect country identification, the Spotify album search was partially successful but incomplete, and no playlists were found for the specified Spotify user.

    "final_answer": "# Summer Music Festival Research Results\n\nI've researched the different aspects for your summer music festival planning, but unfortunately encountered several limitations with the tools. Here's what I found:\n\n## 1) Top 5 Greatest Summer Songs (Billboard)\n\nThe Billboard tool encountered an error when trying to retrieve the Greatest of All Time Songs of the Summer chart. The specific error was a host connection issue (ENOTFOUND), meaning the database server couldn't be reached. I'm unable to provide the top 5 summer songs as requested.\n\n## 2) Cruilla Music Festival's Spotify Profile\n\nI successfully retrieved information about the Cruilla music festival's Spotify profile:\n\n- **Display Name**: cruilla\n- **Spotify URL**: https://open.spotify.com/user/cruilla\n- **Follower Count**: 3\n- **Profile Images**: None available\n\nThis profile has very limited information and a small follower base, which suggests it may not be the official profile for the festival or may not be actively maintained for curation purposes.\n\n## 3) Trending Music on Spotify\n\nI retrieved partial information about trending music on Spotify's homepage for the US region. The data shows:\n\n**Trending Songs Section:**\n- \"Drum Show\" by Twenty One Pilots (Album: Drum Show)\n- \"Everybody Scream\" by Florence + The Machine (Album: Everybody Scream)\n\nNote: The tool returned incomplete data, showing only 2 out of 20 trending songs that were available. This provides limited insight into current trending artists.\n\n## 4) Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' on SoundCloud\n\nThe tool was unable to retrieve download options for Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' on SoundCloud. The error message indicated: \"HQ audio is not available to BASIC users. Please subscribe to a higher plan.\" No metadata about the track was provided.\n\n## 5) SoundCloud Artists with 'Summer' in Their Name\n\nThe search found 88,188 SoundCloud users with \"Summer\" in their name. The top results include:\n\n1. **Summer Walker**\n   - Verified artist with 408,074 followers\n   - Based in Atlanta, Georgia\n   - 171 tracks and 22 playlists\n\n2. **DAVE SUMMER**\n   - 23,349 followers\n   - 45 tracks and 36 playlists\n   - Has management and booking contact information\n\nNote: The tool only returned partial information for 2 out of 10 requested profiles, and the data for the second profile was cut off.\n\n## 6) Dhoni: The Untold Story Soundtrack on Apple Music\n\nThe Apple Music tool failed to retrieve any information about the soundtrack. The returned data shows empty values for album, artist, thumbnail, date, and track count.\n\n## Summary\n\nUnfortunately, most of the research requests encountered significant limitations or errors. The most useful information obtained was about SoundCloud artists with \"Summer\" in their name (particularly Summer Walker who has a large following) and basic details about the Cruilla festival's Spotify profile. For comprehensive festival planning, you would need additional research through alternative sources.",

Here's her complete discography:\n\n- **Room 93** (Released: October 27, 2014)\n- **Badlands (Deluxe Edition)** (Released: August 28, 2015)\n- **Hopeless Fountain Kingdom (Deluxe)** (Released: June 2, 2017)\n- **Manic** (Released: January 17, 2020)\n- **If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power** (Released: August 27, 2021)\n\n**Note:** The output for the first tool appears to be truncated, so there may be additional albums not shown in the results.\n\n### Badlands Album Details\n\nThe second tool successfully retrieved specific information about Halsey's 'Badlands (Deluxe Edition)' album:\n\n- **Release Date:** August 28, 2015\n- **Contains:** 15 songs (identified by IDs only)\n\n**Limitation:** While we can see the album contains 15 songs, the actual song titles were not provided in the response, only their IDs.\n\n## 2. Billboard's All-Time Greatest Hot 100 Songs\n\nThe Billboard_v2 tool encountered an error when attempting to retrieve the top 10 all-time greatest Hot 100 songs. The error message indicates a host connection issue: \"getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND billboard.cctuex9y9o7b.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com\". This information is unavailable for your presentation.\n\n## 3. Current Trending Albums on Genius\n\nThe Genius - Song Lyrics tool returned an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to retrieve trending albums for the week. This information is unavailable for your presentation.\n\n## 4. Available Music Genres for Radio Stations\n\nThe 50K Radio Stations tool successfully retrieved genre information, but returned very limited data:\n\n- Only one genre was returned: **Music** (ID: 62)\n\n**Limitation:** This result is extremely limited and doesn't provide the diverse genre classification you would need for your presentation. The tool may require different parameters or may have encountered an issue retrieving the full genre list.\n\n## 5. Children's Songs by Bellman\n\nThe kjoller tool successfully retrieved one children's song composed by Bellman:\n\n- **Title:** Bj\u00f8rnen sover\n- **Melody by:** C.M. Bellman\n- **Album:** test (no release year provided)\n- **Tags:** klasiker, dyr\n\n**Limitation:** Only one song was returned, which suggests either Bellman has very few compositions in this database or the search was incomplete.\n\n## 6. M.S. Dhoni Soundtrack Album\n\nThe Apple Music tool attempted to retrieve information about the \"M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story\" soundtrack album but returned empty results. All fields (album, artist, thumb, date, count) were either null or empty. This information is unavailable for your presentation.\n\n## 7. Albums Currently Charting on Genius\n\nThis information was not successfully retrieved, as it appears you used the same Genius tool that encountered an error in request #3.\n\n## Summary\n\nYour music presentation will need to rely primarily on the partial Halsey discography information and the single children's song by Bellman that were successfully retrieved. Unfortunately, most of the requested information (Billboard charts, trending albums, comprehensive genre listings, M.S. Dhoni soundtrack details) could not be obtained due to various errors and limitations in the tool responses. You may need to seek alternative data sources to complete your comprehensive music presentation.",

Here's what I was able to retrieve:\n\n## 1) Top 10 Artists on Genius Charts\n\nThe Genius tool returned an error (HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error), so I couldn't retrieve the top 10 artists on Genius charts for this month as requested.\n\n## 2) Top 5 Tracks on Spotify's Global Weekly Chart\n\nThe Spotify Scraper tool returned an error indicating that this endpoint is not available to BASIC users and requires a subscription to a higher plan. Therefore, I couldn't access the current top 5 tracks on Spotify's global weekly chart.\n\n## 3) Halsey's Popularity on YouTube Music\n\nThe YouTube Music API search for Halsey returned partial results:\n\n- **Top Result**: Halsey (Artist)\n  - Subscribers: 61.4M\n  - This indicates significant popularity on the platform\n\n- **Notable Song**: \"Without Me\"\n  - Duration: 3:22\n  - Explicit content: Yes\n  - Video Type: Music Video\n\nNote that the tool output was cut off, so there may be additional search results that weren't displayed.\n\n## 4) Random Halsey Song Excerpt\n\nSuccessfully retrieved a random song excerpt from Halsey:\n\n- **Song**: \"More\"\n- **Album**: \"Manic\" (Released: January 17, 2020)\n- **Excerpt**:\n  \"They told me once, nothing grows\n  When a house ain't a home\n  Is it true, honestly\"\n\nThis excerpt could potentially be used for promotional material as requested.\n\n## 5) The Weeknd on Shazam\n\nThe Shazam search for The Weeknd returned partial results:\n\n- **Top Result**: \"Timeless\" by The Weeknd & Playboi Carti\n  - The tool output was cut off, so complete details about The Weeknd's cross-platform presence on Shazam couldn't be determined.\n\n## 6) Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' on SoundCloud\n\nThe SoundCloud Scraper returned an error indicating that high-quality audio is not available to BASIC users and requires a subscription to a higher plan. Therefore, I couldn't retrieve detailed information about Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' track.\n\n## 7) Trimmed Version of a Popular Song\n\nThe Miza song trimming tool returned an error message stating that the endpoint '/ytdlp' does not exist, so I couldn't create a trimmed version of a popular song for use as a festival intro.\n\n## Summary\n\nUnfortunately, most of the tools either returned errors or provided incomplete information. The most substantial data obtained was about Halsey's presence on YouTube Music (61.4M subscribers) and a song excerpt from \"More\" from her album \"Manic\". To create a balanced festival lineup with comprehensive cross-platform data, you would need to either upgrade the tool access plans or explore alternative data sources.",

For specific artists, I'm interested in looking up Halsey on YouTube Music - in English please, with about 20 results - and could you also grab a random song excerpt with album details from her discography? I'm curious about The Weeknd too - can you search for him on Shazam using US locale settings, limiting it to 5 results? As for individual tracks, I'd love information on Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' on SoundCloud, particularly the high-quality download metadata.

It would be interesting to discover a random piece of her artistry, maybe with some context about which album it's from. I'm also intrigued by The Weeknd's presence in the US music scene - just a small sample of 5 results would satisfy my curiosity.

I'm also nostalgic about what dominated screens during the pandemic's first year - which videos captured everyone's attention then? I was hoping to see which artists are making waves today, and what fresh sounds Canadians are enjoying this season. It would be refreshing to hear some global broadcasts from unexpected places - perhaps a handful of stations from different corners of the world?

    "hard_rewrite": "I've been exploring different music scenes lately. I stumbled across a Halsey track that really caught my attention - I'd love to know more about the album it's from. Also, I've been curious about what's trending in Vietnamese music on YouTube. Speaking of lyrics, I've been trying to understand the storytelling in Taylor Swift's 'All Too Well' - what insights does Genius have about it? I'm also interested in that British singer-songwriter with the ginger hair and mathematical album titles - I think his Spotify ID is '6eUKZXaKkcviH0Ku9w2n3V'. What albums has he released? I'm looking for some classic albums that have stood the test of time - what's currently on the Catalog Albums chart? And I can't get 'Bohemian Rhapsody' out of my head - where can I find different versions of it? By the way, what songs were popular right before the pandemic hit in mid-March 2020? Oh, and could you retrieve that media file I saved earlier with the reference code 'XYZ123'?"

These skills were evident on her earliest hits, especially the neo-tribute \u201cTim McGraw,\u201d but her second album, 2008\u2032s Fearless, showcased a songwriter discovering who she was and, in the process, finding a mass audience.

Rauw Alejandro (3,194,700,937 views)\n\nNote: While the tool returned the top artists, it didn't specifically highlight which ones had featured collaborations. The output was also truncated after the 30th artist.\n\n## 3. International Jazz Radio Stations\n\nThe Radio World API returned 20 international jazz radio stations (out of 557 total stations) that you can stream during your event:\n\n1.

RadioTunes - Mellow Smooth Jazz (Country not specified)\n\nNote: The output was truncated after the 4th station, so we don't have the complete list of 20 stations.\n\n## 4. Ennio Morricone's Music Availability\n\nThe MusiclinkssApi search found multiple Ennio Morricone profiles across music platforms. The main artist profile is available on Spotify at: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1nIUhcKHnK6iyumRyoV68C\n\nOther related profiles include:\n- Ennio Morricone Orchestra\n- Ennio Morricone e i Cantori Moderni di Alessandroni\n- Orchestra di Ennio Morricone\n\nNote: The output was truncated and didn't provide information about availability across all platforms, only showing Spotify links.\n\n## 5.

Some highlights include:\n\n1. \"Pearl & The Oysters \u274d Vitamin D\" (3:24)\n2. \"My Baby Grand\" (2:44)\n3. \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure OST - Pillar Men Theme\u300eAwaken\u300f\" (3:55)\n4. \"JOYWAVE - Rearranged\" (2:59)\n5. \"Feng Suave - People Wither\" (5:12)\n6.

Detailed Information about \"Bad Guy\" by Billie Eilish\n\nThe tool execution didn't provide information about \"Bad Guy\" by Billie Eilish. Instead, it returned details about \"River Flows In You\" by Yiruma, which appears to be an error or mismatch in the query parameters.\n\n## 7.

Current Global Top 200 Songs on Spotify\n\nThe Spotify_v3 tool returned information about the current global top songs on Spotify. The top 3 songs are:\n\n1. \"Golden\" by HUNTR/X, EJAE, AUDREY NUNA, REI AMI, KPop Demon Hunters Cast (7,780,435 streams)\n2. \"back to friends\" by sombr (5,552,656 streams)\n3.

On another note, I've been captivated by contemporary piano compositions lately - could you find what that Italian composer with the flowing minimalist style has published on audio sharing platforms? I believe his Spotify profile has a specific identifier starting with '2uFUB'. Speaking of international music scenes, I'm curious about what was trending in Japan's music charts during spring 2019, particularly around early May. For my evening listening, I'm hoping to discover some refined instrumental broadcasts - what options might exist if one appreciates orchestral arrangements? Finally, I've been thinking about that legendary Italian film composer known for spaghetti western soundtracks, and would enjoy some continuous musical programming while I work."

As part of my research on global artists, I'd like to pull up detailed information about the K-pop idol Jisoo by her stage name.

I'm also curious about radio stations in Tokyo, Japan (country ID: 63). Lastly, could you grab information about BTS using their Spotify URL (https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Nrfpe0tUJi4K4DXYWgMUX) and tell me what radio stations are available on the Kooed platform?",

There's this K-pop performer who goes by a single name that sounds like 'Ji-soo' - I'd love to learn more about her background. I'm also trying to understand YouTube music video trends - specifically what was popular during spring 2022 (around the 15th week) and which videos from 2020 have had the most staying power. I've been told Tokyo has interesting radio stations - are there any listings available? And speaking of popular artists, that Korean group with the URL ending in '3Nrfpe0tUJi4K4DXYWgMUX' on Spotify - what's their story? I've also heard about a platform called Kooed for radio - what options does it offer?"

    "final_answer": "# Global Music Industry Analysis: Comparing Metrics of Success\n\nI've gathered data from various sources to help with your comprehensive global music industry analysis. However, several tools encountered errors or provided limited information, which I'll note throughout this report.\n\n## 1. Billboard's All-Time Greatest Artists\n\n**Tool Contribution:** The Billboard_v2 tool attempted to retrieve Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists chart.\n\n**Results:** Unfortunately, the tool encountered a connection error (ENOTFOUND) and was unable to retrieve any data. This is a significant limitation for your analysis as this would have provided historical context on artist success metrics.\n\n## 2. Recent Independent Albums (October 2022)\n\n**Tool Contribution:** The Billboard API_v2 successfully retrieved data on Independent Albums for the week of October 8, 2022.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- Top 5 independent albums for that week:\n  1. \"Un Verano Sin Ti\" by Bad Bunny (21 weeks on chart)\n  2. \"5SOS5\" by 5 Seconds Of Summer (new entry)\n  3. \"Flawless Like Me\" by LUCKI (new entry)\n  4. \"Subject To Change\" by Kelsea Ballerini (new entry)\n  5. \"If I Know Me\" by Morgan Wallen (165 weeks on chart)\n\n**Limitation:** The output was truncated, showing only 8 entries out of the full chart, which limits our understanding of the complete independent music landscape.\n\n## 3. YouTube's Top Artists from 2019\n\n**Tool Contribution:** The MusicData API successfully retrieved YouTube's top artists from 2019 based on view counts.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- Top 10 YouTube artists of 2019 by views:\n  1. BTS (3,977,298,636 views)\n  2. Daddy Yankee (3,859,704,066 views)\n  3. Blackpink (3,589,853,376 views)\n  4. Anuel AA (3,582,600,888 views)\n  5. Marshmello (3,581,393,665 views)\n  6. Ariana Grande (3,373,573,862 views)\n  7. Ed Sheeran (3,327,187,222 views)\n  8. Neha Kakkar (3,274,845,809 views)\n  9. Billie Eilish (3,195,999,027 views)\n  10. Bad Bunny (2,954,619,873 views)\n\n**Limitation:** The output appears to be truncated at around 30 artists, preventing a complete view of the rankings.\n\n## 4. Current Popular Mood Categories in German Music\n\n**Tool Contribution:** The YouTube Music API successfully retrieved mood categories available in the German language.\n\n**Key Findings:**\nThe German music market organizes music into various genres including:\n- Pop (\"Pop\")\n- Hip-Hop (\"Hip-Hop\")\n- Rock (\"Rock\")\n- Dance & Electronic (\"Dance & Elektro\")\n- Classical Music (\"Klassische Musik\")\n- R&B & Soul\n- Latin\n- K-Pop\n- J-Pop\n\n**Limitation:** The output was truncated and only showed genre categories rather than specific mood categories, which limits our understanding of emotional classification in German music.\n\n## 5. Taylor Swift's 'Folklore' Album Details on Spotify\n\n**Tool Contribution:** The Spotify Web API successfully retrieved detailed information about Taylor Swift's \"folklore (deluxe version)\" album.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- Album: \"folklore (deluxe version)\"\n- Artist: Taylor Swift\n- Release Date: August 18, 2020\n- Total Tracks: 17\n- First track: \"the 1\" (3:30 duration)\n\n**Limitation:** The output was truncated, showing only partial track information rather than the complete album details.\n\n## 6. Top Indonesian Songs from May 2022\n\n**Tool Contribution:** The Billboard-API attempted to retrieve Indonesia Songs chart for May 7, 2022.\n\n**Results:** The tool returned an error message indicating that this endpoint is only available on the Ultra plan and above. No data was retrieved for this component of your analysis.\n\n## 7. Sample of Global Radio Stations\n\n**Tool Contribution:** The Radio World API was queried to retrieve a random sample of 10 radio stations.\n\n**Results:** The tool encountered an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error and failed to provide any data on global radio stations.\n\n## 8. Information about Ennio Morricone as an Artist\n\n**Tool Contribution:** The MusiclinkssApi successfully retrieved information about Ennio Morricone.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- Multiple Spotify artist entries exist for Ennio Morricone, suggesting his broad impact across different projects\n- The primary artist entry has ID: 1nIUhcKHnK6iyumRyoV68C\n- Related artists include Andrea Morricone, Piero Piccioni, and Dario Marianelli\n- Various orchestra configurations associated with his work are also listed\n\n## Summary\n\nYour comprehensive global music industry analysis faces significant limitations due to several tool failures and incomplete data. The analysis provides insights into independent albums from October 2022, YouTube's top artists from 2019, German music genre categories, Taylor Swift's \"folklore\" album, and information about Ennio Morricone. However, we were unable to retrieve data on Billboard's all-time greatest artists, top Indonesian songs, or global radio stations. To complete a truly comprehensive analysis comparing different metrics of success across platforms and regions, additional data collection would be necessary.",

There's this fascinating album I discovered with the code '1pzvBxYgT6OVwJLtHkrdQK' - what can you tell me about it? I'm also researching Indonesian music trends from spring 2022, particularly early May.

I'm also researching music industry trends from mid-October last year - who was dominating the artist rankings then? For my playlist project, I need suggestions for groups with electric guitars and drums, and I'd love to see what curated collections the green music app officially recommends. I'm planning a trip to Japan and want to tune into local broadcasts in its capital city. Also searching for artists who blend saxophone improvisations with melancholy chord progressions.

There's this beautiful track with ocean imagery I heard once - something about a 'saltwater room'? I think it was by that firefly-inspired artist. And that emotional Ed Sheeran song with the picture theme - I'd love to know more about its technical details. I stumbled across this YouTube Music channel with '4Tune' in the name that had copyright-free music - what else do they offer?

NCT 127 (peak position: 2, weeks on chart: 9)\n3. Jhene Aiko (peak position: 3, weeks on chart: 16)\n4. BTS (peak position: 1, weeks on chart: 179)\n5.

Billie Eilish (peak position: 1, weeks on chart: 81)\n9. The Weeknd (peak position: 1, weeks on chart: 244)\n10. Roddy Ricch (peak position appears truncated)\n\n## 2. SoundCloud Classical Music Playlist by Ludovico Einaudi\n\nThe SoundCloud search tool did not return any results for Ludovico Einaudi classical playlists. This appears to be an error or limitation with the tool execution.\n\n## 3. Random Halsey Song\n\nThe tool provided \"Bells in Santa Fe\" from Halsey, with lyrics including:\n- \"Don't call me by my name / All of this is temporary\"\n- \"Well, maybe I could hold you in the dark / You won't even notice me depart\"\n- \"It's not a happy ending\"\n\n## 4. Halsey's Album Discography\n\nHalsey's complete album discography includes:\n1. Room 93 (Released: October 27, 2014)\n2. Badlands (Deluxe Edition) (Released: August 28, 2015)\n3. Hopeless Fountain Kingdom (Deluxe) (Released: June 2, 2017)\n4. Manic (Released: January 17, 2020)\n5. If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power (Released: August 27, 2021) - Note: This entry appears truncated in the tool output\n\n## 5. International Jazz Radio Stations\n\nThe search returned 557 jazz radio stations worldwide. The top results include:\n1. Christmas Mix - Smooth Jazz Christmas (USA)\n2. Amazing Christmas Music Jazz and More (USA)\n3. TDI Radio - Jazz (Serbia)\n4. Power - Smooth Jazz (Country information truncated)\n\nNote: The tool only returned partial results from the first page (15 stations out of 557).\n\n## 6. Children's Songs with 'Rainbow' in the Title\n\nThe search for children's songs with 'rainbow' in the title returned no results (empty data array).\n\n## 7. YouTube Music Watch Playlist for Taylor Swift's 'Lover'\n\nThe tool did not return a playlist for Taylor Swift's 'Lover'. Instead, it appears to have returned a watch playlist for a different video (ID: 1A7Qw88As64) by artist Eko Fresh with a track titled \"Aber\". This suggests an incorrect video ID was used in the query.\n\n## 8. Related Songs to Billie Eilish's 'bad guy'\n\nThe tool returned related songs, but they appear to be for a different track than requested. The results show songs related to what seems to be a German rap track, including:\n1. \"Masafaka\" by Sido\n2. \"Gheddo Reloaded (feat. Sido)\" by Eko Fresh\n3. \"Endstation (Live)\" by Sido\n\nThis suggests an incorrect browse ID was used in the query.\n\n## 9. HTML Structure of Kooed Radio Website\n\nThe Kooed Radio endpoint did not return any HTML structure or website information. The output is empty, suggesting either an error with the tool or that additional parameters may be required.",

After exploring that snapshot in time, my ears were craving something more soothing, so I searched for some elegant piano compositions in the classical genre - that Italian composer whose minimalist style is so recognizable. I limited my exploration to just a handful of collections to avoid overwhelm. Then my mood shifted, and I wondered what that distinctive female artist with blue hair might have in her discography - you know, the one who performed at SNL and has that unique vocal style. I wanted to sample something random from her work and get a sense of her full album history. Later, feeling nostalgic for improvisation and brass, I hunted for some radio stations that specialize in that genre born in New Orleans, sorting through quite a few options to find the most relevant ones. For my child's upcoming music class, I tried finding some colorful songs about that atmospheric phenomenon that appears after rain. To finish my musical journey, I checked out what automatically plays after that YouTube video with ID '1A7Qw88As64', explored some related tracks for that specific browse ID, and wanted to see what broadcast options might be available through that radio service platform."

Yeat (peaked at #2, 3 weeks on chart)\n9. \"Monaco\" by Bad Bunny (incomplete data)\n\nNote: The tool output was cut off after the 9th entry, so we don't have the complete top 100 list.\n\n## 2. Billboard Global Excluding US Chart\n\nThe Billboard Global Excl. US chart shows international hits trending outside the United States as of November 1, 2023:\n\n1. \"Si No Estas\" by Inigo Quintero (previously #1)\n2. \"Seven\" by Jung Kook featuring Latto (previously #1)\n3. \"Greedy\" by Tate McRae (previously #3)\n4. \"Cruel Summer\" by Taylor Swift (previously #4)\n5. \"Paint The Town Red\" by Doja Cat (previously #1)\n\nNote: The tool output was cut off after the 5th entry, so we don't have the complete chart. Additionally, some HTML formatting appears in the artist names.\n\n## 3. Fastest Music Videos to Reach 1 Billion Views on YouTube\n\nThe following videos reached 1 billion views the fastest:\n\n1. Adele - \"Hello\" (87.4 days)\n2. Luis Fonsi - \"Despacito\" ft. Daddy Yankee (96.5 days)\n3. Ed Sheeran - \"Shape of You\" (97.4 days)\n4. J Balvin, Willy William - \"Mi Gente\" (102.7 days)\n5.

Cardi B (129.0 days)\n10. Justin Bieber - \"Sorry\" (136.2 days)\n\nNote: The tool output was cut off after the 14th entry, but we have a substantial list of the fastest videos.\n\n## 4. Trending Music Videos in South Korea\n\nThe tool for retrieving trending music videos in South Korea returned no data. This information is unavailable from the current tool execution.\n\n## 5. New Music Releases in Sweden\n\nThe Spotify New Releases tool for Sweden returned an error: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\" We are unable to provide information about new music releases in Sweden.\n\n## 6. Recent Music Videos from Genius\n\nThe Genius Videos tool returned an error indicating missing required parameters: \"missing_required_parameters\" with \"artist_id\" being required. Without this parameter, we cannot retrieve recent music videos from Genius.\n\n## 7. Classical Music Playlists on SoundCloud\n\nThe SoundCloud Scraper tool for classical music playlists returned no data. This information is unavailable from the current tool execution.\n\n## 8. Popular Songs on Spotify Matching 'World Music'\n\nThe Spotify Search tool returned results for \"world music\" tracks:\n\n- Total tracks found: 919\n- Top result: \"World A Music\" by iNi Kamoze from the album \"Ini Kamoze\"\n- Second result: \"Baby\" from the album \"My World 2.0\"\n\nNote: The tool output was cut off after the second track, so we have very limited information about the full search results.\n\n## 9. YouTube Music Watch Playlist for K-pop Video\n\nThe YouTube Music API returned a watch playlist for video ID \"1A7Qw88As64\" (\"Aber\" by Eko Fresh):\n\n- Playlist ID: RDAMVM1A7Qw88As64\n- First track: \"Aber\" by Eko Fresh (5:32, 306K views)\n- Second track: A song from the album \"KKS\" by Kool Savas featuring Nessi (3:04)\n\nNote: The tool output was cut off after the second track, so we don't have the complete playlist. Additionally, the video ID provided appears to be for a German rap song rather than K-pop as requested.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your global music showcase event, we've gathered partial data on US and international music trends. The Billboard charts show Taylor Swift, Doja Cat, and SZA dominating in the US, while Inigo Quintero and Jung Kook lead internationally. For viral content, Adele's \"Hello\" remains the fastest video to reach 1 billion views on YouTube. Unfortunately, several tools returned incomplete data or errors, particularly for South Korean trends, Swedish releases, Genius videos, SoundCloud playlists, and comprehensive Spotify world music results. The YouTube Music playlist data appears to be for a German rap video rather than K-pop. This partial dataset provides some insights into global music trends but would need to be supplemented with additional research for a comprehensive presentation.",

There's also this YouTube Music track I'm analyzing (browse_id: MPTRt_ZXONnvFeQpN) - what songs are related to it? I'm curious about which artists are trending on Genius today - maybe the top 10? Also, which YouTube videos published in 2020 have received the most views? For my global radio section, could you pull a comprehensive list of countries with radio stations, up to about 500? I'm doing a section on Halsey, so I need all of her albums and a random song by her. Finally, I'd like to reference the Billboard Artist 100 chart specifically from May 15, 2023.",

Which videos from 2020 really captured the world's attention? I'm planning a global music documentary - which countries have active radio scenes? I've been getting into that artist who released 'Without Me' - what's her full discography like? Which musicians were climbing the charts around mid-May last year? And finally, could you surprise me with something from that same 'Without Me' artist that I might not have heard before?"

Billboard's Greatest of All Time Songs of the Summer (Top 10)\n\nUnfortunately, the Billboard API returned an error when attempting to retrieve this data.

Current Billboard 200 Chart\n\nThe Billboard API provided partial data for the current Billboard 200 chart (as of 2023-11-15):\n\n1. Taylor Swift - \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\"\n2. Jung Kook - \"Golden\"\n3. Drake - \"For All The Dogs\"\n4. Morgan Wallen - \"One Thing At A Time\"\n5. Bad Bunny - \"Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va A Pasar Manana\"\n6.

The API response showed:\n```\n{'success': True, 'has_next': False, 'total': 0, 'data': []}\n```\nThis suggests either an issue with the search parameters or limitations in the API's data for US cities.\n\n## 8.

I'm curious about those iconic songs that defined our summers historically - maybe the top 10 would give me a good overview? Also, what were people watching most on YouTube in 2022? I was flipping through my old Billboard magazine collection and wondered what was charting around mid-November last year. For my radio station project, I need to understand what subcategories exist within the rock music world. I'm researching Latin pop icons and particularly interested in that Colombian artist with the hips that don't lie - what's her profile like on streaming platforms? I'm creating a lyric analysis project and need the words to that nostalgic Ed Sheeran song about preserving memories in photographs. Where could I find radio broadcasts in the Big Apple? Which artists dominated YouTube collaborations in 2022? I'm studying British bands with cosmic themes in their work - what's their discography like? And finally, for my music production class, I need to examine the audio characteristics of that catchy Weeknd track with all the 80s synth vibes."

Next, specific album information was retrieved from Spotify (album ID: 3cfAM8b8KqJRoIzt3zLKqw) using the Spotify_v3 Get Albums endpoint. To understand current music trends, the Genius Leaderboard was consulted for the top 10 artists/songs from the past month. The search then moved geographically to Indonesia, looking up available radio stations in that country using the 50K Radio Stations database. Detailed artist information was obtained for a specific Spotify artist (ID: 06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02) using Spotify_v2's Artist Details endpoint. Global weekly top tracks were retrieved from Spotify Scraper to understand worldwide music trends. The exploration continued with finding related artists for a specific artist (ID: 6eUKZXaKkcviH0Ku9w2n3V) using Spotify_v2's Related Artists tool. A sample of 10 radio stations was pulled from Radio World's homepage feature.

I started by discovering this collection of songs (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXFwTY00FRUUZzL_Vjhy-bE8WIao3eyOi) that really caught my attention. While exploring that sound, I became curious about this particular album (3cfAM8b8KqJRoIzt3zLKqw) and wanted to understand what's been trending in the music world this past month. My interests then took me to Southeast Asia - I've always wondered what radio options people have in Indonesia. There's this one artist (06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02) who's been absolutely everywhere lately, and I'm trying to understand what makes them so globally popular. I'm also looking to branch out from another favorite artist of mine (6eUKZXaKkcviH0Ku9w2n3V) by finding similar sounds. I'd love to sample what's currently featured on radio stations around the world too. For a creative project, I'm thinking of blending three different audio pieces together - a YouTube clip (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zXcC-haBFc), this interesting audio file (http://i.mizabot.xyz/d/Bc5SdZDrKg), and this Discord audio (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688253918890688521/829266927003107338/paladin.ogg) into one OGG file. Oh, and I'm also curious about this Spotify user profile (cruilla) I stumbled across recently."

    "query": "I'm exploring music trends and artists across different platforms and regions. First, I checked the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart for October 15, 2023, focusing on the top 5 songs. I then looked at the Billboard Global Excl. US chart from September 23, 2023, to compare international trends outside America. To get historical context, I examined Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists list (top 10). I explored Taylor Swift's related artists on Spotify using her artist ID (06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02). I also checked Genius's monthly leaderboard for the top 10 trending artists/songs. For radio stations, I looked up stations in both Japan (country ID 103) and Canada (country ID 26), limiting results to 10 stations each. I searched for lyrics from Halsey's song 'Without Me' and got details about The Weeknd on Spotify using his artist ID (1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ). Finally, I searched Shazam for information about BTS's song 'Dynamite', limiting results to 5 entries.",

Oh, and I've been wondering about the lyrics to Halsey's 'Without Me' - could you find those? Also, can you grab details about The Weeknd on Spotify using his artist ID (1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ)?

I was curious about what's topping the charts in Japan right now - maybe the first handful of entries from mid-October 2023? I'm also wondering how those compare with what's popular internationally outside the US from late September. For context, I'd love to understand who the music industry considers the most legendary artists of all time. Speaking of artists, I've been listening to a lot of Taylor Swift lately (that artist with ID 06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02) and would like to discover similar voices. I'm also curious which artists are generating the most buzz this month according to lyric searches. For my upcoming travels, I'd like to know what radio stations I might tune into in both Montserrat and America - just a sampling of each would be fine. There's also this particular Halsey song with lyrics about filling cups and putting someone back on their feet that I can't get out of my head. And while we're discussing influential artists, I'd appreciate some background on that Canadian artist with ID 1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ who makes dark R&B. Finally, what can you tell me about that catchy BTS song that was everywhere in 2020? Just the top few results would be perfect."

The tool did not return acoustic tracks similar to Coldplay's 'Yellow' as requested.\n\n3) **Genius Platform Top Contributors**\nThe Genius Leaderboard API returned partial information about top contributors for the month, including:\n- User \"resonare\" (Editor) with an attribution value of 146,365.2\n- User \"BritishJuggernaut\" (Editor) with an attribution value of 140,156.4\n\nHowever, the response was truncated, showing only 2 out of the requested 10 contributors, and didn't include any playlist curation insights.\n\nTo create your music-themed party playlist combining international hits and Indonesian favorites, I would need to gather additional information using different tools or parameters.

Songs Related to Dua Lipa's 'Levitating'\n\nThe YouTube Music API returned related songs, but there appears to be a mismatch in the results. The data shows songs by German rapper Sido and Eko Fresh rather than content related to Dua Lipa's 'Levitating'. This suggests either an incorrect browse_id parameter was used or the API returned unexpected results. The songs returned include:\n\n- \"Masafaka\" by Sido (from album \"Das goldene Album\")\n- \"Gheddo Reloaded (feat. Sido)\" by Eko Fresh (from album \"Deutscher Traum\")\n- \"Endstation (Live)\" by Sido (from album \"Blutzbr\u00fcdaz - Die Mukke zum Film\")\n\nThese results don't appear to match your request for songs similar to 'Levitating'. For your party playlist, you might want to manually search for songs with similar disco-pop vibes like:\n- \"Don't Start Now\" (also by Dua Lipa)\n- \"Blinding Lights\" by The Weeknd\n- \"Physical\" by Dua Lipa\n- \"Save Your Tears\" by The Weeknd\n\n## 2. Information about Taylor Swift's 'Midnights' Album\n\nThe Spotify Web API returned information about an album called \"Kan\" by UZI instead of Taylor Swift's \"Midnights\". This indicates an incorrect album ID was used in the request. The data shows:\n\n- Album: \"Kan\" by UZI\n- Release date: March 19, 2021\n- 10 tracks total\n\nFor your Taylor Swift themed decoration section, you would need accurate information about the \"Midnights\" album, which was not provided by the tool. The album was released in October 2022 and features tracks like \"Anti-Hero,\" \"Lavender Haze,\" and \"Midnight Rain\" with a midnight blue and starry aesthetic that would work well for decorations.\n\n## 3. Trending Songs in Indonesia (May 2022)\n\nUnfortunately, the Billboard-API returned an error message stating: \"This endpoint is available on the Ultra plan and above. If you want to access this endpoint, please upgrade your plan.\"\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide information about songs trending in Indonesia in May 2022. To get this information, you would need to:\n- Upgrade the API plan\n- Try an alternative music chart service\n- Research Indonesian music charts from May 2022 through other sources\n\n## Summary\n\nUnfortunately, the tools did not provide the specific information you requested for your music-themed party. The YouTube Music API returned unrelated German rap songs instead of content similar to \"Levitating\", the Spotify API returned information about a different album than Taylor Swift's \"Midnights\", and the Billboard API for Indonesian trends was not accessible due to plan limitations. I recommend searching for this information through other means to properly plan your international music-themed party.",

Here's what the official Spotify account looks like:\n\n- **Display Name**: Spotify\n- **Profile URL**: https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify\n- **ID**: spotify\n- **Followers**: 12,444,994\n- **Profile Images**:\n  - Small image (64x64): https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67757000003b8255c25988a6ac314394d3fbf5\n  - Large image (300x300): https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6775700000ee8555c25988a6ac314394d3fbf5\n- **URI**: spotify:user:spotify\n\nThe official Spotify account has over 12.4 million followers and maintains an official presence on the platform.\n\n## Radio Dosis Mix Streaming\n\nI attempted to stream Radio Dosis Mix as requested. However, the tool returned binary data that cannot be properly displayed in text format. This appears to be audio stream data that would normally be played through an audio player. Unfortunately, I cannot stream this audio directly in this text-based interface.\n\n## Summary\n\nI was able to successfully retrieve the Spotify user profile for 'spotify', showing it has over 12.4 million followers.

Morgan Wallen (1st week at #1, 209 weeks on chart)\n2. SZA (peak position #1, 184 weeks on chart)\n3. Taylor Swift (peak position #1, 450 weeks on chart)\n4. The Weeknd (peak position #1, 400 weeks on chart)\n5. Luke Combs (peak position #1, 314 weeks on chart)\n6. Kali Uchis (new entry with award, peak position #6, 25 weeks on chart)\n7. Nicki Minaj (new entry with award)\n\n**Note**: The tool returned only the top 7 artists from the chart, with Nicki Minaj's entry being cut off mid-data.\n\n## Billie Eilish's Album Catalog on Spotify\nBillie Eilish's album catalog includes:\n\n1. HIT ME HARD AND SOFT (2024-05-17)\n2. Happier Than Ever (2021-07-30)\n3. WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? (2019-03-29)\n4. Guess featuring billie eilish (2024-08-01)\n5. L'AMOUR DE MA VIE [OVER NOW EXTENDED EDIT] (2024-05-21)\n6. What Was I Made For? [From The Motion Picture \"Barbie\"] (2023-07-13)\n7. hotline (edit) (2023-05-09)\n8. Guitar Songs (2022-07-21)\n9. Happier Than Ever (Edit) (partial information)\n\n**Note**: The tool returned only partial information for the last album, and there may be more albums in her catalog that weren't included in the results.\n\n## Radio Stations in France\nUnfortunately, there was an issue with the radio station search. While we requested stations from country ID 73 (which the tool identified as Reunion Island, not mainland France), the search returned 0 results.

This appears to be an error or limitation in the tool execution, as we would expect to see the current top 20 trending songs worldwide from Shazam.\n\n## 2. Billboard's Greatest Hot 100 Songs of All Time (Top 10)\n\nThe Billboard_v2 tool for retrieving the Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs encountered a connection error. The specific error message indicates a host not found issue with the Billboard database server:\n\n```\ngetaddrinfo ENOTFOUND billboard.cctuex9y9o7b.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com\n```\n\nThis means we were unable to retrieve the requested top 10 songs from Billboard's Greatest Hot 100 Songs of all time.\n\n## 3. Billboard Global Excl. US Chart (September 2023)\n\nThe Billboard Global Excl. US chart for September 23, 2023 was successfully retrieved, though the data appears to be truncated. Here are the top songs from the available data:\n\n1. \"Seven\" by Jung Kook featuring Latto (Rank: 1, Last Week: 1)\n2. \"Paint The Town Red\" by Doja Cat (Rank: 2, Last Week: 2)\n3. \"Slow Dancing\" by V (Rank: 3, Last Week: 3)\n4. \"LaLa\" by Myke Towers (Rank: 4, Last Week: 1)\n5. \"Vampire\" by Olivia Rodrigo (Rank: 5, Last Week: 1)\n6. \"Cruel Summer\" by Taylor Swift (Rank: 6, Last Week: 4)\n7. \"Qlona\" by Karol G & Peso Pluma (Rank: 7, Last Week: 6)\n\nNote: The data appears to be cut off after the 7th entry, so we don't have the complete chart information. Additionally, the HTML tags in the artist names suggest this data would need cleaning for presentation purposes.\n\n## 4. Songs with 'Summer' in the Title\n\nThe Shazam auto-complete tool provided limited suggestions for the term \"summer\":\n\n1. \"summer walker\" (likely referring to the artist)\n2. \"summer\" (general term)\n3. \"summertime sadness\" (song by Lana Del Rey)\n\nThis is a very limited list and only provides one actual song title with \"summer\" in it. For a comprehensive presentation, you would need to conduct additional research to find more summer-themed songs.\n\n## Summary\n\nUnfortunately, the tool execution results were quite limited. We were only able to retrieve partial data from the Billboard Global Excl. US chart for September 2023, showing Jung Kook featuring Latto's \"Seven\" as the #1 song internationally at that time. The Shazam trending data and Billboard's Greatest Hot 100 Songs data were not successfully retrieved due to technical errors. The summer-themed song suggestions were also very limited, with only \"Summertime Sadness\" being clearly identified as a song title.\n\nFor your comprehensive music analysis presentation, I would recommend attempting to gather this data again or using alternative sources to ensure you have complete information across all three categories you're interested in analyzing.",

    "final_answer": "# Music Content for Your Podcast\n\n## 1. Ludovico Einaudi Albums\n\nUnfortunately, the SoundCloud Scraper tool did not return any results for Ludovico Einaudi albums. This appears to be a technical limitation or error with the tool execution. For your podcast background music needs, I would recommend researching Einaudi's notable classical piano works such as:\n\n- \"Divenire\"\n- \"In a Time Lapse\"\n- \"Elements\"\n- \"Nightbook\"\n- \"Islands: Essential Einaudi\"\n\nThese albums feature his signature minimalist piano compositions that would work well as podcast background music.\n\n## 2. Inspirational Music Quotes\n\nThe Radio World quotes tool returned 15 quotes, but **none of them are specifically about music**. This is a limitation of the tool's response, as it provided general quotes across various categories rather than music-themed ones. Here are the quotes returned:\n\n1. \"You can tell your uncle stuff that you could not tell your dad. That is kind of the role of an uncle. I feel very much like a father sometimes but sometimes I feel like a teammate.\" - Dusty Baker\n2. \"If your best friend has stolen your girlfriend, it does become life and death.\" - Ben Kingsley\n3. \"The grounding in natural sciences which I obtained in the course of my medical studies, including preliminary examinations in botany, zoology, physics, and chemistry, was to become decisive in determining the trend of my literary work.\" - Johannes Vilhelm Jensen\n4. \"We need to keep hope alive and strive to do better.\" - Kofi Annan\n5. \"I know for me the subject of how to be in a relationship is precious and complicated and challenging.\" - Helen Hunt\n6. \"Small minds are concerned with the extraordinary, great minds with the ordinary.\" - Blaise Pascal\n7. \"Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence.\" - Hal Borland\n8. \"Virtue is a state of war, and to live in it we have always to combat with ourselves.\" - Jean-Jacques Rousseau\n9. \"The best part of beauty is that which no picture can express.\" - Francis Bacon\n10. \"Those who govern, having much business on their hands, do not generally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new projects. The best public\" - Benjamin Franklin (note: this quote appears to be cut off)\n\nPlus 5 more quotes that were not visible in the truncated output.\n\n## 3. Songs Related to 'Experience' by Ludovico Einaudi\n\nThe YouTube Music API returned related songs, but there appears to be a mismatch in the results. The returned songs are primarily by the artist Sido and appear to be German rap/hip-hop tracks, which don't match the emotional tone of Einaudi's \"Experience.\" The songs returned include:\n\n- \"Masafaka\" by Sido\n- \"Gheddo Reloaded (feat. Sido)\" by Eko Fresh\n- \"Endstation (Live)\" by Sido\n\nThis suggests there was an error with the browse_id parameter used in the query. For a podcast featuring Einaudi's \"Experience,\" you would want similar neoclassical or contemporary classical pieces that match its emotional depth and minimalist style.\n\n## 4. Lyrics for \"Nuvole Bianche\"\n\nThe YouTube Music API returned no lyrics for this query. This is actually expected since \"Nuvole Bianche\" is an instrumental piano composition without lyrics. The title translates to \"White Clouds\" in Italian, which could be discussed as a thematic element. For your podcast, you could analyze the emotional themes of the piece based on its musical structure, tempo changes, and the imagery evoked by its title rather than through lyrics.\n\n## Summary\n\nUnfortunately, the tool executions provided limited useful information for your podcast needs. The SoundCloud search returned no results, the quotes weren't music-related, the related songs didn't match Einaudi's style, and there were no lyrics for the instrumental piece as expected. I would recommend conducting additional research to gather appropriate content for your music-themed podcast.",

Earlier today, I was browsing through some musical collections on that orange-logoed audio platform, particularly interested in more traditional orchestral pieces by that Italian composer known for minimalist piano works. I limited my search to avoid being overwhelmed. While waiting for those tracks to load, I found myself reading through some interesting thoughts from radio personalities - just skimmed through the first batch of quotes they had available. Later, I wanted to discover music similar to that haunting melody I found (the one with that strange alphanumeric reference that started with 'MPTR'). I was also curious about the poetic elements behind another piece with a similar reference code starting with 'MPLY', wondering if the words matched the emotional quality of the music."

Burna Boy's Album Discography\n\nThe MusiclinkssApi provided Burna Boy's album discography, which includes:\n\n1. \"No Sign of Weakness\" (Release date: July 10, 2025) - Note: This appears to be a future release\n2. \"I Told Them...\" (Release date: August 24, 2023)\n3. \"Love, Damini\" (Release date: July 7, 2022)\n4. \"Twice As Tall\" (Release date: August 12, 2020)\n5. \"African Giant\" (Release date: July 24, 2019)\n6. \"Outside\" (Release date: January 26, 2018)\n7. \"Redemption\" (Release date: Not fully shown in the tool output)\n\n**Note:** The tool output was truncated, so this may not be Burna Boy's complete album discography.\n\n## 3. Children's Songs by Carl Orff\n\nThe search for children's songs composed by Carl Orff returned no results. The tool response indicated \"status: OK\" but returned an empty data array. This suggests either:\n- The database does not contain children's songs by Carl Orff\n- The search parameters may need refinement\n- Carl Orff may be better known for his educational music approach (Orff Schulwerk) and compositions like \"Carmina Burana\" rather than specific children's songs in the database\n\n## 4. Billboard's Top 10 Greatest Songs of All Time\n\nUnfortunately, the Billboard API encountered an error when attempting to retrieve the Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs chart. The error message indicates a host connection problem (\"getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND\"), meaning the database server could not be reached. Therefore, this information is not available from the provided tool execution results.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your music presentation, you have information on top Afrobeats songs from October 2022 (though the list is incomplete) and Burna Boy's partial album discography.

Halsey's Music Appropriateness\n\nI attempted to gather information about Halsey, but there was a mismatch in the tool execution. The Spotify tool returned information about INNA instead of Halsey. However, I did receive a random Halsey song lyric snippet from another tool.\n\nThe random song retrieved was \"Bells in Santa Fe\" with lyrics that include themes like:\n- \"Don't call me by my name\"\n- \"Better off dead, so I reckon I'm headed to Hell instead\"\n- \"Jesus needed a three-day weekend to sort out all his bullshit\"\n\nBased on this sample, Halsey's music appears to contain mature themes and explicit language that would not be appropriate for a children's music event. The lyrics touch on adult concepts and include language unsuitable for young audiences.\n\n## 2. Top 10 Greatest Summer Songs (Billboard)\n\nUnfortunately, the Billboard tool encountered an error when attempting to retrieve the Greatest of All Time Songs of the Summer chart. The specific error was a host connection issue (\"getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND\"). Therefore, I cannot provide the requested list of top 10 greatest summer songs according to Billboard.\n\n## 3. Children's Songs from '\u00c5h Abe'\n\nI was able to retrieve one song from the '\u00c5h Abe!' album:\n\n**\"Jeg er en papeg\u00f8je fra Amerika\" (I am a parrot from America)**\n- By: Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner (Danish version by Halfdan Rasmussen)\n- Melody by: Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner\n- Album: \u00c5h Abe!\n- Release Year: 1993-1999\n\nThe song appears to be a cheerful children's song about a parrot from America. The lyrics are in Danish and include fun, child-friendly content with repeating phrases like \"\u00c5 falleri og fallera.\"\n\nNote: The tool only returned one song from the album, though there are likely more songs available that weren't included in the response.\n\n## 4. Creating Extended Versions of Children's Songs\n\nI attempted to use a tool to create a 30-minute extended version of a children's song from YouTube, but the tool returned an error message: \"Endpoint '/ytdlp' does not exist\". Therefore, I cannot provide specific guidance on creating an extended version using this particular tool.\n\nAlternative approaches for creating extended versions might include:\n- Using audio editing software like Audacity to loop the song\n- Finding royalty-free extended versions online\n- Hiring a DJ who specializes in children's events to create custom mixes\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your summer-themed children's music event:\n1. Halsey's music appears inappropriate for a children's event based on the sample lyrics.\n2. I couldn't retrieve Billboard's top summer songs due to a technical error.\n3. The '\u00c5h Abe!' album contains at least one child-friendly song in Danish that could work for your event, though only partial information was available.\n4. The tool for creating extended versions returned an error, so you'll need to explore alternative methods for background music during breaks.",

Next, they accessed a children's song album titled '\u00e5h abe' using the kjoller tool.

I'm also curious about what's considered classic summer music - can you pull the top 10 songs from Billboard's 'Greatest of All Time Songs of the Summer' chart? For my kid's playlist, I want to check out that children's album '\u00e5h abe' using the kjoller tool. Finally, there's this YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UR-l3QI2nE) that I'd like to convert to MP3 format using Miza's Song trimming/extending tool - could you make it 30 minutes long without changing the start time?",

Then I was in the mood for some poetic lines and wondered what unexpected gems Halsey's catalog might reveal if I let chance decide. After that, I was curious about what songs have historically defined summer according to the music industry experts - particularly the all-time greats in the top 10. I also needed something for my nephew who loves Danish children's music, especially that collection with the monkey in the title. Finally, I found this amazing YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UR-l3QI2nE) that I'd love to have as background music for my meditation session, which usually lasts about half an hour - is there a way to get that as an audio file that loops to fill that time?"

Here are the details:\n\n1. **R\u00e1dio 104 FM Bezerros** (Brazil) - Genre: Language\n2. **Radio Atl\u00e1ntida** (Bolivia) - Genre: Theme\n3. **R\u00e1di\u00f3 1** (Hungary) - Genre: Community\n4. **GotRadio - Piano Perfect** (USA) - Genre: Other\n5. **Gartenwelt Frey** (Germany) - Genre: Dance\n6. **R\u00e1dio Mil Gl\u00f3rias** (Brazil) - Genre: Religion\n\n*Note: The tool only returned 6 complete radio station entries out of the requested 15. The output appears to have been truncated.*\n\n## Upcoming Concerts in the US\n\nThe Spotify Concerts tool returned information about events in the US, with one specific concert at RFK Stadium in Washington:\n\n**Event Details:**\n- **Venue:** RFK Stadium, Washington\n- **Date:** July 15, 2023 at 8:00 PM\n- **Featured Artists:** Lil Uzi Vert, Jazmine Sullivan, and others\n\n*Note: The concert information appears to be outdated as it shows a 2023 event. Additionally, the tool output was truncated, so there may be more current concerts that weren't displayed.*\n\n## Halsey's 'Manic' Album Details\n\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool provided the following information about the 'Manic' album:\n\n- **Album Name:** Manic\n- **Release Date:** January 17, 2020\n- **Artist:** Halsey\n- **Number of Songs:** 15 tracks (IDs were provided but not the actual track names)\n\n## Track Information\n\n### \"Blinding Lights\" by The Weeknd\n- **Album:** After Hours (released March 20, 2020)\n- **Duration:** 3 minutes 20 seconds (200,040 ms)\n- **Explicit:** No\n- **Popularity:** 89 (out of 100)\n\n### \"Dance Monkey\" by Tones and I\n*Note: While this track was requested, the tool output for this track appears to have been truncated, so I cannot provide complete details.*\n\n## The Weeknd's Album Catalog\n\nUnfortunately, the tool for retrieving The Weeknd's album catalog (artist ID: 1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ) returned an HTML error page instead of the expected album information. I cannot provide details about his discography based on the available data.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your music-themed weekend, you have information about several international radio stations to explore, though the list is incomplete. There was one concert listed at RFK Stadium, but it's from 2023 and likely already occurred. You have basic details about Halsey's 'Manic' album and some information about 'Blinding Lights' by The Weeknd, but the information about 'Dance Monkey' was incomplete.

Also, I'm planning some travel in the States and wondering if any artists I follow might be performing while I'm there. Speaking of artists, I've heard Halsey's 'Manic' era was significant - what exactly was in that collection? There are also these two songs that keep showing up in my recommendations with these strange codes - '0VjIjW4GlUZAMYd2vXMi3b' and '1rgnBhdG2JDFTbYkYRZAku'. What are they actually? And lastly, that Canadian artist with the distinctive hairstyle who did the Super Bowl halftime show - I'd love to see his full catalog of work.

Trending Music on Spotify's US Home Page\n\nThe Spotify Scraper tool successfully retrieved trending music information from the US region. Here's what's currently trending:\n\n**Trending Songs Section:**\n- \"Drum Show\" by Twenty One Pilots (Album: Drum Show)\n- \"Everybody Scream\" by Florence + The Machine (Album: Everybody Scream)\n\n**Note:** The tool output appears to be truncated, showing only 2 tracks out of what seems to be 20 total items mentioned in the response. The complete trending list would contain more songs than what's shown here.\n\n## 2. New Official Music Releases in Spain\n\n**Error Encountered:** The Spotify _v2 New Releases tool returned an error message indicating that the API was unreachable. The specific error was: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\" Therefore, I cannot provide information about new music releases in Spain at this time.\n\n## 3. Radio Station Genres Available Globally\n\nThe 50K Radio Stations tool returned a very limited result when searching for music genres:\n\n- Only 1 genre was returned: \"Music\" (ID: 62)\n\n**Limitation:** This result is extremely limited and doesn't provide the comprehensive list of radio station genres that was requested. The tool may require different parameters or may have encountered an issue with retrieving the full genre list.\n\n## 4. Information About Billie Eilish\n\nThe YouTube Music API provided partial information about Billie Eilish:\n\n**Albums:**\n- \"HIT ME HARD AND SOFT\"\n- \"Happier Than Ever\" (Explicit)\n- \"WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?\"\n- \"dont smile at me\"\n\n**Channel ID:** UCiGm_E4ZwYSHV3bcW1pnSeQ\n\n**Partial Description:** \"Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell is an American singer-songwriter and musi...\"\n\n**Limitation:** The tool output appears to be truncated. It doesn't include Billie Eilish's top songs as requested, and the artist description is cut off. The complete artist profile would contain more information.\n\n## 5. Top 10 Songs on Spanish Billboard Chart (May 7, 2022)\n\n**Access Restriction:** The Billboard-API tool returned a notice stating: \"This endpoint is available on the Ultra plan and above. If you want to access this endpoint, please upgrade your plan.\" Therefore, I cannot provide the requested Billboard chart information for Spain.\n\n## Summary\n\nI was only able to partially fulfill your request for international music data. I provided limited information on US trending songs on Spotify and some basic details about Billie Eilish's albums. Unfortunately, I encountered significant limitations with most of the tools: the Spanish new releases API was unreachable, the radio genres list was extremely limited, Billie Eilish's information was incomplete, and the Spanish Billboard chart data required a premium subscription. For a comprehensive international music showcase, you would need to seek alternative data sources or resolve these tool access issues.",

US chart data from May 20, 2023, which shows international music trends outside the United States:\n\n- **#1**: \"Un x100to\" by Grupo Frontera X Bad Bunny (maintained position from last week)\n- **#2**: \"Cupid\" by Fifty Fifty (maintained position from last week)\n- **#3**: \"La Bebe\" by Yng Lvcas x Peso Pluma (moved up from position #2)\n- **#4**: \"Ella Baila Sola\" by Eslabon Armado X Peso Pluma (moved up from position #2)\n- **#5**: \"Flowers\" by Miley Cyrus (dropped from position #1)\n- **#6**: \"Idol\" by YOASOBI (moved up from position #4)\n\n**Note**: The tool returned only partial data, showing just the top 6 songs and with incomplete information about weeks on chart and peak positions.\n\n## 2. Halsey's 'Manic' Album Information\n\nI've gathered basic information about Halsey's album 'Manic':\n\n- **Release Date**: January 17, 2020\n- The album contains 15 songs (only song IDs were provided, not titles)\n\n**Limitation**: The tool only returned minimal metadata about the album without song titles, track durations, or other detailed information that would be useful for your case study.\n\n## 3. Background Music Stream\n\nThe attempt to stream background music from Emisora Radio Dosis returned binary data that cannot be properly displayed or used in this format.\n\n**Error**: The streaming data is in binary format and cannot be properly processed in this context.\n\n## 4. Lyrics for Halsey's \"Without Me\"\n\nThe attempt to retrieve lyrics for Halsey's \"Without Me\" resulted in an error:\n\n**Error Message**: \"The given URL is not a track URL of SoundCloud.\"\n\nThe tool appears to be designed for SoundCloud URLs, but a Spotify URL was provided instead.\n\n## 5. \"M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story\" Soundtrack Information\n\nThe attempt to retrieve information about this soundtrack from Apple Music was unsuccessful:\n\n**Error**: The tool returned empty values for album, artist, thumbnail, date, and track count.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your comprehensive music presentation, I was only able to provide partial information about the Billboard Global Excl. US chart and very basic details about Halsey's 'Manic' album. The other three requests (background music streaming, lyrics for \"Without Me\", and information about the \"M.S. Dhoni\" soundtrack) were unsuccessful due to tool limitations or errors. You may need to use alternative sources to gather the complete information needed for your presentation.",

Also, I've been trying to sing along to that track at spotify.com/track/6FZDfxM3a3UCqtzo5pxSLZ but need the words with timestamps.

Billboard's Greatest Artists of All Time (Top 10)\nUnfortunately, the Billboard_v2 tool encountered a connection error when attempting to retrieve the greatest artists of all time. The specific error message indicates a host not found issue with the Billboard database server. You'll need to try this request again later or seek this information from an alternative source for your dashboard.\n\n## 2. Latest Catalog Albums Chart Data\nThe Billboard API for catalog albums is currently unreachable. The tool returned an error message indicating that while your client and the gateway are working, the API itself is not responding. You'll need to try again later or find an alternative source for this chart data.\n\n## 3. Selection of K-pop Songs by BTS\nThe K-POP songs tool successfully returned information about BTS songs. Here are the results:\n\n| Song Name | Release Date | Korean Name | Video Link | Release Type |\n|-----------|--------------|-------------|------------|---------------|\n| Blood Sweat & Tears | 2016-10-09 | \ud53c \ub540 \ub208\ubb3c | https://youtu.be/hmE9f-TEutc | Major |\n| Black Swan | 2020-03-05 | - | https://youtu.be/0lapF4DQPKQ | Minor |\n| Stay Gold | 2020-06-26 | - | https://youtu.be/9IHwqdz8Xhw | Japanese |\n| Save ME | 2016-05-15 | \uc138\uc774\ube0c\ubbf8 | https://youtu.be/GZjt_sA2eso | Major |\n| Butter (Hotter Remix) | 2021-05-28 | - | https://youtu.be/YLXfyHsfFz0 | Minor |\n| Lights | 2019-07-02 | - | https://youtu.be/eaUpme4jalE | Japanese |\n| Butter | 2021-05-21 | \ubc84... | [truncated] | [truncated] |\n\nNote: The output appears to be truncated, so there may be additional BTS songs that weren't included in the response.\n\n## 4. Curated List of Worldwide Radio Stations\nThe Radio World tool successfully returned a list of radio stations for your homepage. Here are some of the stations retrieved:\n\n| Radio Name | Country | Genre | Stream URL |\n|------------|---------|-------|------------|\n| R\u00e1dio 104 FM Bezerros | Brazil | Language | http://player.srvsh.com.br/proxy/8000 |\n| Radio Atl\u00e1ntida | Bolivia | Theme | http://stream.zenolive.com/7dwkv4yhr2zuv |\n| R\u00e1di\u00f3 1 | Hungary | Community | http://icast.connectmedia.hu/5212/live.mp3 |\n| GotRadio - Piano Perfect | USA | Other | http://206.217.213.235:8050/ |\n| Gartenwelt Frey | Germany | Dance | http://stream.laut.fm/gartenweltfrey |\n| R\u00e1dio Mil Gl\u00f3rias | [country truncated] | Religion | http://stm12.xcast.com.br:8226/; |\n\nNote: The output was truncated, so only 6 out of the requested 15 radio stations are shown above.\n\n## 5. Lyrics for Coldplay's 'Viva La Vida'\nThe YouTube Music API returned no lyrics for the provided browse ID. The response indicates that no lyrics were found for this specific request. You may need to try a different browse ID or use an alternative lyrics service for your dashboard.\n\n## 6. Collection of General Radio Stations\nThe Kooed tool for retrieving general radio stations returned an empty response. No data was provided for the website's secondary section.\n\n## Summary\nOf the six information requests for your music discovery dashboard, only two were partially successful:\n1. A selection of BTS K-pop songs (though the data appears truncated)\n2. A partial list of worldwide radio stations (only 6 out of 15 requested stations were visible in the response)\n\nThe other four requests encountered various issues including connection errors, API unavailability, empty responses, or no matching data. To complete your dashboard, you'll need to retry these requests or find alternative data sources for the missing information.",

Global Top 10 Tracks on Spotify\n**Tool Contribution: Spotify Scraper: List Top Tracks**\n\nUnfortunately, this tool returned an error indicating that the endpoint is not available to basic users and requires a subscription to a higher plan. Therefore, I cannot provide the current global top 10 tracks on Spotify from this source.\n\n## 2. BLACKPINK Information\n**Tool Contribution: K-POP: girl-groups**\n\nThe tool successfully retrieved information about BLACKPINK:\n\n- **Group Name**: BLACKPINK (Korean: \ube14\ub799\ud551\ud06c)\n- **Debut Date**: August 8, 2016\n- **Company**: YG Entertainment\n- **Members**: 4 (Original members: 4)\n- **Active Status**: Yes\n\nNote that some fields like Group Profile, Short Group Name, and Fanclub Name were not available in the data returned.\n\n## 3. Radio Stations in South Korea\n**Tool Contribution: Radio World - getStationByCountry**\n\nThe tool was queried for country_id 124, but this returned radio stations for Liberia, not South Korea. The tool appears to have been provided with an incorrect country ID. Therefore, I cannot provide information about South Korean radio stations from this data.\n\nThe partial data for Liberia shows stations like:\n- Roots 102.7 FM (World Music)\n- Radio Maria Liberia (Religion)\n- LBS Online\n- Hott FM 107.9\n\nNote that the output was cut off mid-response, so this is only a partial list of Liberian stations.\n\n## 4. Countries with Radio Stations\n**Tool Contribution: Radio World - getAllCountry**\n\nThe tool successfully began retrieving a list of countries with radio stations, showing:\n\n- Total countries: 219\n- First few countries (alphabetically):\n  - Afghanistan (10 radio stations)\n  - Albania (54 radio stations)\n  - Algeria (77 radio stations)\n  - American Samoa (3 radio stations)\n  - Andorra (13 radio stations)\n  - Angola (23 radio stations)\n  - Anguilla (1 radio station)\n  - Antigua and Barbuda (20 radio stations)\n  - Argentina (2,439 radio stations)\n  - Armenia (20 radio stations)\n  - Aruba (32 radio stations)\n  - Australia (partial data)\n\nImportantly, the output was cut off after Australia, so this is only a partial list of the 219 countries available in the database.\n\n## 5. Most Streamed Spotify Songs from 2022\n**Tool Contribution: MusicData API: /spotify/topsongs/{year}**\n\nThe tool successfully retrieved the most streamed songs on Spotify for 2022:\n\n1. Harry Styles - As It Was (3,579,823,134 streams, 1,473,038 daily)\n2. SZA - Kill Bill (2,121,683,555 streams, 1,737,217 daily)\n3. Manuel Turizo - La Bachata (1,940,736,906 streams, 1,164,647 daily)\n4. Bad Bunny - Me Porto Bonito (1,920,111,308 streams, 690,595 daily)\n5. David Guetta - I'm Good (Blue) (1,846,968,799 streams, 1,141,329 daily)\n6. Bizarrap - Quevedo: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 52 (1,783,726,114 streams, 602,017 daily)\n7. Taylor Swift - Anti-Hero (1,682,153,105 streams, 773,033 daily)\n8. Sam Smith - Unholy (1,646,944,757 streams, 645,706 daily)\n9. Bad Bunny - Tit\u00ed Me Pregunt\u00f3 (1,593,263,524 streams, 545,994 daily)\n10. Bad Bunny - Ojitos Lindos (1,517,194,371 streams, 655,501 daily)\n\nThe data continued beyond the top 10, but was cut off mid-response, so the complete list is not available.\n\n## 6. Drake's Public Playlists\n**Tool Contribution: Spotify _v2: Get user Playlists**\n\nThe tool returned an error message indicating that the API was unreachable. The message specifically stated: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider\" with additional information \"Your Client (working) ---> Gateway (working) ---> API (not working)\". Therefore, I cannot provide information about Drake's public playlists.\n\n## Summary\n\nBased on the available data, I can provide partial information for your comprehensive music report:\n\n- **BLACKPINK**: Basic profile information is available, showing they are a 4-member K-pop girl group that debuted in 2016 under YG Entertainment and are currently active.\n\n- **Global Radio Distribution**: The database contains information on 219 countries with radio stations, though we only received partial data for the first 11 countries alphabetically.\n\n- **2022 Spotify Hits**: Harry Styles' \"As It Was\" was the most streamed song of 2022 with over 3.5 billion streams, followed by SZA's \"Kill Bill\" and Manuel Turizo's \"La Bachata\". Bad Bunny had multiple entries in the top 10.\n\nUnfortunately, several components of your request could not be fulfilled due to API limitations or errors:\n- Current global top 10 tracks on Spotify (subscription required)\n- South Korean radio stations (incorrect country ID provided)\n- Drake's public playlists (API unreachable)\n\nTo complete your comprehensive music report, you would need to seek alternative data sources for these missing components.",

Here are the top songs:\n\n1. \"Lovin On Me\" by Jack Harlow (\u2191 from #2 last week)\n2. \"Cruel Summer\" by Taylor Swift (\u2193 from #1 last week)\n3. \"Paint The Town Red\" by Doja Cat (same as last week)\n4. \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" by Mariah Carey (\u2191 from #17 last week)\n5. \"Snooze\" by SZA (\u2193 from #4 last week)\n6. \"I Remember Everything\" by Zach Bryan Featuring Kacey Musgraves (same as last week)\n7. \"Greedy\" by Tate McRae (\u2191 from #8 last week)\n8. \"Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree\" by Brenda Lee (new entry)\n\n**Note**: The tool returned only the first 8 entries of the Hot 100 chart, with the output being truncated.\n\n## 2. Most Viewed Asian Music Videos on YouTube (Last 24 Hours)\nI found the following trending Asian music videos:\n\n1. \"Aaj Ki Raat\" from Stree 2 (4,503,437 views, 15,011 likes)\n2. \"Shree Hanuman Chalisa\" by Gulshan Kumar/Hariharan (2,329,835 views, 7,517 likes)\n3. \"Aaj Ki Raat\" (alternate version) from Stree 2 (2,116,182 views, 6,656 likes)\n4. \"Ruaa Ruaa\" from Fateh (2,032,173 views, 3,461 likes)\n5. \"Aayi Nai\" from Stree 2 (1,893,816 views, 4,866 likes)\n6. \"KISSIK Song\" from Pushpa 2 (1,806,413 views, 6,646 likes)\n7. \"\u0e08\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e48 (\u0e88\u0eb7\u0ec8\u0e9a\u0ecd\u0ec8)\" by \u0e01\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e07 \u0e17\u0e38\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e07\u0e34\u0e19 (1,565,605 views, 2,919 likes)\n8. \"KISSIK\" (Hindi version) from Pushpa 2 (1,468,617 views, 10,966 likes)\n9. \"Angaaron\" from Pushpa 2 (1,468,079 views)\n\n**Note**: The output appears to be truncated after the 9th entry.\n\n## 3. Radio Stations in Jakarta, Indonesia\nI searched for radio stations in Jakarta, Indonesia, but the tool returned no results. The API response showed: `{'success': True, 'has_next': False, 'total': 0, 'data': []}`. This suggests either there are no stations indexed in the database for Jakarta, or there might be an issue with the search parameters.\n\n## 4. Song Suggestions with \"Summer Love\"\nThe search for songs containing \"summer love\" returned limited suggestions:\n- \"summer love\"\n- \"summer love songs\"\n- \"donna summer love to love you baby\"\n\nThese appear to be search term suggestions rather than actual song titles. The tool provided only search hints rather than comprehensive song listings.\n\n## 5. Trending Indonesian Songs on Billboard\nUnfortunately, I couldn't access the Billboard Indonesia chart data. The tool returned an error message: \"This endpoint is available on the Ultra plan and above. If you want to access this endpoint, please upgrade your plan.\"\n\n## 6. K-pop Song Lyrics\nThe attempt to retrieve K-pop lyrics was unsuccessful. The tool returned: `{'lyrics': None, 'source': None}`. This could be due to an invalid browse_id parameter or limitations in the API's access to the requested content.\n\n## Summary\nI was able to partially fulfill your request for a global music exploration dashboard. I successfully retrieved the Billboard Hot 100 chart (though truncated) and the most viewed Asian music videos on YouTube. However, I encountered limitations with the other requests: no radio stations were found for Jakarta, only search suggestions were provided for \"summer love\" songs, access to the Billboard Indonesia chart was restricted by subscription level, and the K-pop lyrics request returned no data. To build a more comprehensive dashboard, we would need to address these limitations with alternative data sources or upgraded API access.",

US chart data from May 20, 2023 shows:\n\n- Top 5 songs:\n  1. \"Un x100to\" by Grupo Frontera X Bad Bunny\n  2. \"Cupid\" by Fifty Fifty\n  3. \"La Bebe\" by Yng Lvcas x Peso Pluma\n  4. \"Ella Baila Sola\" by Eslabon Armado X Peso Pluma\n  5. \"Flowers\" by Miley Cyrus\n\n**Note:** The tool returned only partial data, showing just the first 7 entries of the chart, with the 7th entry being incomplete.\n\n## 2. Spotify's Top Songs from 2022\n\nThe top songs on Spotify for 2022 were:\n\n1. \"As It Was\" by Harry Styles (3.58B streams)\n2. \"Kill Bill\" by SZA (2.12B streams)\n3. \"La Bachata\" by Manuel Turizo (1.94B streams)\n4. \"Me Porto Bonito\" by Bad Bunny (1.92B streams)\n5. \"I'm Good (Blue)\" by David Guetta (1.85B streams)\n\n**Note:** The tool returned only partial data, showing 18 entries with the 18th entry being incomplete.\n\n## 3. Indonesian Radio Stations\n\nThe search for Indonesian radio stations returned 621 total stations, with the first few being:\n\n- RDI 99.6 FM (Pop genre)\n- Prambors FM Jakarta (Pop genre)\n- Trax FM (Pop genre)\n- MTAFM (Community genre)\n\n**Note:** The tool returned only the first 15 stations out of 621 total stations, and the 4th entry was incomplete.\n\n## 4. Billboard Indonesia Chart Data\n\nUnfortunately, the Billboard Indonesia Songs chart data could not be accessed due to a subscription limitation. The tool returned an error message: \"This endpoint is available on the Ultra plan and above. If you want to access this endpoint, please upgrade your plan.\"\n\n## 5. Halsey's Discography\n\nHalsey's album discography includes:\n\n1. \"Room 93\" (2014)\n2. \"Badlands (Deluxe Edition)\" (2015)\n3. \"Hopeless Fountain Kingdom (Deluxe)\" (2017)\n4. \"Manic\" (2020)\n5. \"If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power\" (2021)\n\nEach album contains multiple songs, though the complete song listings were not fully provided in the tool output.\n\n## 6. Spotify Artist Collaborations\n\nThe attempt to search for \"Halsey collaborations\" on Spotify returned a configuration error: \"Config Error!2 Please try again.\" No data was retrieved from this tool call.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your global music analysis project, I've gathered partial data on current global charts and 2022 Spotify trends, showing artists like Bad Bunny appearing on both lists. I've identified Indonesian radio stations that might feature these trending songs, though Billboard Indonesia chart data was unavailable due to subscription limitations. Halsey's discography spanning 2014-2021 was retrieved, but the Spotify search for artist collaborations failed due to a technical error. The data collected provides a starting point for identifying cross-cultural music trends, though several tools returned incomplete results or errors that limit the comprehensiveness of the analysis.",

I'm also wondering what radio stations locals tune into in Jakarta and surrounding areas. There's this American artist with blue hair who performed at Coachella - I'd love to explore her discography and see who she's worked with musically. And finally, I'm interested in seeing what was topping the charts locally in that Southeast Asian archipelago around the same time last spring - just the cream of the crop."

    "final_answer": "# Comprehensive Music Discovery Results\n\n## 1. Latest Album Releases in Canada\nThe Spotify New Releases tool returned an error message: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\" Unfortunately, I cannot provide information about the latest album releases in Canada at this time due to this technical issue.\n\n## 2. Jazz Radio Stations in the United States\nThe 50K Radio Stations tool successfully executed but returned no results. The search for jazz radio stations in the United States (country_id: 50) yielded zero stations in the database (total: 0). This could indicate either a limitation in the database coverage for jazz stations or an issue with the search parameters.\n\n## 3. Taylor Swift's Albums on Spotify\nThe Spotify Get Albums tool returned partial information. Only one album was successfully retrieved, while the other requested albums returned null values. The tool's output was also truncated, showing only partial details of the album. From what was returned:\n\n- One album has 30 tracks\n- It's available in numerous markets worldwide\n- The album has a Spotify ID of 6kZ42qRrzov54LcAk4onW9\n\nHowever, the album name and other critical details were cut off in the response, and I cannot confirm this is actually Taylor Swift's album due to the incomplete data.\n\n## 4. Lyrics for \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen\nThe Genius Song Lyrics search successfully found the song, but the complete lyrics were not included in the response. Key information about the song:\n\n- Artist: Queen\n- Release Date: October 31, 1975\n- The song has complete lyrics in the Genius database (lyrics_state: \"complete\")\n- It has received over 10.6 million pageviews on Genius\n- The lyrics URL is: https://genius.com/Queen-bohemian-rhapsody-lyrics\n\nHowever, the actual lyrics content was not included in the API response.\n\n## 5. Acoustic Cover Versions of \"Hallelujah\"\nThe Miza Song search successfully returned several acoustic covers of \"Hallelujah\":\n\n1. \"Hallelujah - Leonard Cohen /Jeff Buckley (Boyce Avenue acoustic cover)\" - 4:37\n2. \"Kaleb Sanders - 'Hallelujah' Acoustic Cover\" - 4:41\n3. \"Hallelujah - Leonard Cohen (Cover)\" - 6:51\n4. \"HALLELUJAH, acoustic - The greatest version ever!.wmv\" - 3:32\n5. \"hallelujah acoustic cover\" - 3:57\n6. \"One of the BEST covers of hallelujah I've heard!.....\" - 3:57\n7. \"Hallelujah - Leonard Cohen Jeff Buckley (Acoustic Cover)\" (SoundCloud) - 4:26\n\nThe response includes YouTube and SoundCloud links along with thumbnail images and durations.\n\n## 6. Coldplay's Albums from Spotify\nThe MusiclinkssApi successfully retrieved Coldplay's album catalog. Their albums include:\n\n1. \"Moon Music (Full Moon Edition)\" - Released October 6, 2024\n2. \"Moon Music\" - Released October 4, 2024\n3. \"Music Of The Spheres\" - Released October 15, 2021\n4. \"Everyday Life\" - Released November 22, 2019\n5. \"Live in Buenos Aires\" - Released December 7, 2018\n6. \"A Head Full of Dreams\" - Released December 4, 2015\n7. \"Ghost Stories Live 2014\" - Released November 21, 2014\n8. \"Ghost Stories\" - Released May 19, 2014\n9. \"Live 2012\" - Released (date cut off in response)\n\nEach album entry includes the Spotify ID, URL, cover image, and release date.\n\n## Summary\nYour music discovery session yielded mixed results. While I was able to provide information about acoustic covers of \"Hallelujah\" and Coldplay's album catalog, the other requests were either unsuccessful (latest Canadian releases, US jazz radio stations) or returned incomplete data (Taylor Swift's albums, Bohemian Rhapsody lyrics). To complete your music discovery session, you might need to try alternative tools or services for the missing information.",

I've had that iconic operatic rock masterpiece from the British quartet with the royal name stuck in my head - you know, the one about fantasy and reality? Maybe just the top 5 interpretations would help. I'm also in the mood for stripped-down, intimate renditions of that Cohen classic that mentions a biblical king.

    "final_answer": "# Music-Themed Party Planning Information\n\n## Halsey Lyrics for Decorations\nI found some beautiful lyrics from Halsey's song \"More\" from her 2020 album \"Manic\" that would make great party decorations:\n\n- \"Wooden floors and little feet, a flower bud in concrete\"\n- \"I sit and I stare at your clothes in the drawer, I cry and my knuckles get sore\"\n- \"And when you decide it's your time to arrive, I've loved you for all of my life\"\n- \"And nothing could stop me from giving a try, I've loved you for all of my life\"\n\nThese lyrics are emotionally powerful and could make for striking visual elements at your party.\n\n## Upcoming Concerts in the US\nThe tool returned partial information about concerts in the US. It shows there was a concert at RFK Stadium in Washington featuring multiple artists including Lil Uzi Vert and Jazmine Sullivan. However, the data appears to be from July 15, 2023, which is outdated. Additionally, the tool output was cut off mid-response, so I couldn't see the complete list of concerts. For current concert information, you might need to check a more up-to-date source.\n\n## Greatest Artists of All Time\nUnfortunately, the Billboard Greatest of All Time Artists tool encountered an error (SequelizeHostNotFoundError) and couldn't retrieve the list of legendary artists. You might want to consider including universally acclaimed artists like The Beatles, Michael Jackson, Queen, or Madonna in your playlist based on your own knowledge of music history.\n\n## Radio Stations in Jakarta, Indonesia\nThe search for radio stations in Jakarta, Indonesia returned no results. The tool indicated success but found zero stations matching your criteria. You might need to try a different source for streaming international music from Indonesia.\n\n## Trending on Spotify\nThe Spotify home page overview tool showed that \"Drum Show\" by Twenty One Pilots and \"Everybody Scream\" by Florence + The Machine are currently trending songs in the US. Unfortunately, the complete list was cut off in the response, but these two songs would be good additions to keep your playlist current. The tool only provided partial trending information.\n\n## Mood Categories for Playlist Organization\nThe YouTube Music API returned an extensive list of mood categories you could use to organize your playlist sections:\n\n**Moods & Moments:**\n- Chill\n- Commute\n- Energy Boosters\n- Feel Good\n- Focus\n- Party\n- Romance\n\nThere were also numerous genre categories including Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, R&B & Soul, Jazz, Classical, and many more that could help you structure your playlist.\n\n## Classical Music Albums on SoundCloud\nI found one classical music album on SoundCloud: \"Classical Masterpieces: Timeless Pieces from the Great Composers\" by Classical Masters Orchestra. This album contains 100 tracks and has over 2,000 likes. The tool only returned partial results (limited to 5 albums as requested), and even the first result was cut off mid-description. For a more comprehensive selection, you might need to browse SoundCloud directly.\n\n## Summary\nYou now have some Halsey lyrics for decorations, information about trending songs on Spotify, mood categories to organize your playlist, and at least one classical music album from SoundCloud. However, several tools provided incomplete information or encountered errors, so you may need additional resources for a complete party planning solution.",

I'm also wondering if she has any upcoming concerts in the US that I might attend. While we're on the topic of music, I'd love to see Billboard's top 10 greatest artists of all time. Also, can you look up some radio stations in Jakarta, Indonesia? I'm curious about what's currently trending on Spotify's US homepage and what mood categories YouTube Music offers. Finally, could you suggest 5 classical music albums available on SoundCloud?",
    "hard_rewrite": "I've been feeling nostalgic about music lately. I'd love to discover a random piece from that artist with the unique voice who named herself after a star system. What album is it from? I'm also wondering if she's touring anywhere in the States soon. On a different note, I've been debating with friends about musical legends - who would Billboard consider the absolute top ten icons of all time? Also, I'm planning a trip to Indonesia's capital and would love to tune into some local radio while there. And speaking of current trends, what's capturing everyone's attention on the US Spotify homepage these days? I'm also curious about how YouTube Music organizes their emotional categories for music discovery. Finally, I'd appreciate finding some sophisticated orchestral collections on that orange-logo streaming platform - maybe about 5 albums would give me a good starting point."

    "final_answer": "# Music Party Playlist Recommendations\n\nI've gathered information from various music platforms to help you create diverse playlists for your international friends. Here's what I found:\n\n## 1. Billboard 200 Chart (Current US Trends)\n\nThe Billboard 200 tool provided the current top albums in the US:\n\n1. \"One More Time...\" by blink-182 (Rank #1)\n2. \"For All The Dogs\" by Drake (Rank #2)\n3. \"Hackney Diamonds\" by Rolling Stones (Rank #3)\n4. \"Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va A Pasar Manana\" by Bad Bunny (Rank #4)\n5. \"One Thing At A Time\" by Morgan Wallen (Rank #5)\n6. \"Midnights\" by Taylor Swift (Rank #6)\n\nNote: The tool returned only partial results from the Billboard 200 chart, showing just the top 6 albums.\n\n## 2. Spotify Global Top 200\n\nThe Spotify tool returned information about global hits, but the data appears to be incomplete and possibly from a future date (2025). The top songs shown were:\n\n1. \"Golden\" by HUNTR/X, EJAE, AUDREY NUNA, REI AMI, KPop Demon Hunters Cast (Rank #1)\n2. An unnamed track at Rank #2\n\nNote: The tool returned limited results and the data appears to be incorrect with future dates, so I would recommend checking Spotify's official website for current global hits.\n\n## 3. Children's Songs by Bellman\n\nThe tool found one children's song composed by C.M. Bellman:\n\n- \"Bj\u00f8rnen sover\" (The Bear is Sleeping)\n  - A classic children's song with lyrics in Danish\n  - Tags: klasiker, dyr (classic, animals)\n\n## 4. Ennio Morricone's Work\n\nThe search returned several Ennio Morricone-related artists on Spotify:\n\n- Ennio Morricone (main artist profile)\n- Ennio Morricone Orchestra\n- Ennio Morricone, Edda e i Cantori Moderni di Alessandroni\n- Orchestra di Ennio Morricone\n- Ennio Morricone e i Cantori Moderni di Alessandroni\n\nNote: The tool only provided artist names and links, not detailed information about Morricone's compositions or film scores.\n\n## 5. \"\u00c5h Abe\" Album (For Danish Guests)\n\nThe tool found information about the \"\u00c5h Abe!\" album (1993-1999) and returned one song from it:\n\n- \"Jeg er en papeg\u00f8je fra Amerika\" (I am a parrot from America)\n  - Text by Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner, translated to Danish by Halfdan Rasmussen\n  - Melody by Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner\n\nNote: The tool only returned one song from the album, not the complete track listing.\n\n## 6. YouTube Music Details for \"Bohemian Rhapsody\"\n\nThe YouTube Music API returned some metadata for the song, but the output was truncated and didn't provide complete information about the track. The tool showed that the song is available in numerous countries through YouTube Music, but specific details about the song itself were not fully provided.\n\n## 7. Coldplay's \"Viva La Vida\" (Shazam Database)\n\nThe Shazam tool returned information about a completely different song:\n\n- \"Sapralott\" by Wei\u00dfwurscht is\n  - This appears to be a German song, not Coldplay's \"Viva La Vida\"\n\nNote: The tool did not return information about the requested song, possibly due to an incorrect key parameter.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your international music party, you can feature trending US albums from the Billboard 200, include the children's song by Bellman for the kids, showcase some of Ennio Morricone's work for film enthusiasts, and add songs from the \"\u00c5h Abe!\" album for your Danish guests. Unfortunately, the information about Spotify's global hits, \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" and \"Viva La Vida\" was either incomplete or incorrect. I recommend checking these platforms directly for the most accurate and current information.",

I'm also trying to find details about a children's album called '\u00e5h abe', some information on Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody (it has the YouTube Music ID 'fJ9rUzIMcZQ'), and lastly, can you look up details about a specific song with Shazam key '52797836' in English?",

Also, what songs are people streaming the most on a weekly basis right now?

I'm also fascinated by film scores, particularly by that Italian maestro who composed for all those spaghetti westerns. Speaking of children's music, there's this Danish album called '\u00e5h abe' that my niece loves - what songs are on it? And that iconic rock anthem with the operatic middle section - you know, the one with video ID 'fJ9rUzIMcZQ' - what details can you tell me about it? Finally, I heard this catchy tune with Shazam key '52797836' but couldn't understand the lyrics - could you find information about it in English?"

I'm particularly interested in that Canadian artist with the stage name referencing a day of the week - what albums has he released on streaming platforms? I'm also putting together a playlist and need some radio station recommendations that focus on electronic beats and rhythms for dancing - maybe about 20 options sorted from beginning to end? There's this particular track I can't get out of my head (browse ID 'MPLYt_ZXONnvFeQpN') and I'd love to see its words.

The singer and songwriter arrived in 2011 with three mixtapes offering morose ballads that seemed to have no designs on mainstream appeal. Within only a few years, however, Tesfaye had scored a variety of Top Ten pop hits. These included a duet with Ariana Grande (\u201cLove Me Harder\u201d), a dramatic ballad from the soundtrack of Fifty Shades of Grey (the Grammy-winning \u201cEarned It\u201d), a retro-contemporary disco-funk collaboration with Max Martin (\u201cI Can\u2019t Feel My Face\u201d), and a sleek Daft Punk production (\u201cStarboy\u201d). Additionally, Tesfaye topped the Billboard 200 with his second and third proper full-lengths, Beauty Behind the Madness (2015) and Starboy (2016), which also made him a two-time winner of the Grammy for Best Urban Contemporary Album. Tesfaye entered the next decade with After Hours (2020), the chart-topping source of the global smash \u201cBlinding Lights,\u201d and followed up with Dawn FM (2022). He ventured into acting and television production in 2023 as the co-writer, executive producer, and general conceptual force behind the HBO series The Idol. Music for the show naturally included exclusive tracks from the Weeknd, as well as contributions from Madonna, Playboi Carti, MIKE DEAN, and others. \\nBorn in Toronto to Ethiopian immigrants, Abel Tesfaye debuted the Weeknd in late 2010 with three songs uploaded to YouTube. Made with producer Jeremy Rose, they served as a low-key prelude to three mixtapes self-released as free digital downloads the following year. The first one was House of Balloons (March), where clear traces of radio-friendly contemporary R&amp;B \u00e0 la Trey Songz, Jeremih, the-Dream, and Drake were synthesized with the progressive left-of-center likes of Spacek and Sa-Ra.

The tool appears to have executed but did not provide any playlist information.*\n\n## 2. Global Top 50 Songs on Spotify\n**Tool Contribution: Spotify Top 200 Charts**\n\nThe tool returned partial data for the global Spotify charts. Only the top 2 entries were visible in the results:\n\n1. \"Golden\" by HUNTR/X, EJAE, AUDREY NUNA, REI AMI, KPop Demon Hunters Cast\n   - Current Rank: 1\n   - Streams: 53,375,081\n   - Release Date: 2025-06-20\n\n2. Partial information for the #2 track (incomplete data)\n\n*Note: The data appears to be from a future date (2025), which suggests test data or an error in the API response. Additionally, only 2 out of 50 requested tracks were returned.*\n\n## 3. Trending Songs on Genius\n**Tool Contribution: Genius Charts**\n\n*The tool returned an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error. No data about trending songs on Genius could be retrieved.*\n\n## 4. Popular Radio Stations in France\n**Tool Contribution: Radio World**\n\nThe tool was queried for radio stations in France (country_id: 73), but returned:\n- Country identified as \"Reunion Island\" (not mainland France)\n- Total radios: 0\n- No stations were returned\n\n*Note: There appears to be a mismatch between the country ID provided (73) and France. The country ID 73 corresponds to Reunion Island, which is a French overseas department.*\n\n## 5. Children's Songs by Raffi\n**Tool Contribution: Children's Song Database**\n\nThe search for songs by author \"raffi\" returned:\n- Status: OK\n- Data: [] (empty array)\n\n*No songs by Raffi were found in the database.*\n\n## 6.

Music Videos Trending on Genius\n**Tool Contribution: Genius Videos API**\n\n*The tool returned an error indicating missing required parameters. The API requires an artist_id parameter that was not provided.*\n\n## 8. YouTube Music Recommendations Based on Coldplay's \"Viva La Vida\"\n**Tool Contribution: YouTube Music API**\n\nRecommendations based on \"Viva La Vida\":\n1. \"Viva la Vida\" by Coldplay (4:03)\n2. \"A Sky Full of Stars\" by Coldplay (4:14)\n3. Partial information about a Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars track\n\n*Note: The response was cut off after the third recommendation, so the complete list is not available.*\n\n## Summary\n\nYour global music discovery project has encountered several limitations in data collection. Multiple tools returned errors, partial data, or no data at all. The most complete information was obtained for Ed Sheeran's \"Shape of You\" and some YouTube Music recommendations based on Coldplay. The Spotify global charts data appears to be test data from a future date.

Spotify Home Page Trending Content (US Market)\n\nThe Spotify US homepage trending section shows:\n\n- **Top Trending Songs:**\n  1. \"Drum Show\" by Twenty One Pilots\n  2. \"Everybody Scream\" by Florence + The Machine\n\n*Note: The tool output appears to be truncated after the second entry, limiting our ability to analyze the full trending content.*\n\n## 7. Halsey Artist Sample (Random Song)\n\nFor artist comparison, we have information about Halsey's song \"More\" from her 2020 album \"Manic\":\n\n- **Album:** Manic\n- **Release Date:** January 17, 2020\n- **Song:** \"More\"\n- **Lyrics Sample:** \"They told me once, nothing grows / When a house ain't a home / Is it true, honestly\"\n\nThis provides a reference point for comparing artist presentation and thematic content across different streaming platforms.\n\n## 8.

A more comprehensive analysis would require complete datasets from all platforms.",

I'd like to compare these with Spotify's weekly global top tracks from October 8, 2022, as well as YouTube's most viewed videos from 2022. To round out my research, can you include the current top 20 songs across all genres from Genius charts for that week? I'm also curious about what's trending on Spotify's US homepage right now. Finally, I'd appreciate seeing a random song excerpt from Halsey's discography, and could you provide detailed metadata for Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' on SoundCloud, including a standard quality download link?",
    "hard_rewrite": "I'm researching global music consumption patterns from autumn 2022 and need some cross-platform insights. What were African music fans in America listening to during early October last year? I'm curious how that compared with what was trending in Japan around the same time - particularly their top 20 hits. Also, what was captivating global Spotify listeners that week? And which YouTube videos dominated viewership throughout 2022? I'd love to understand what Genius was highlighting across genres during this period too. For a more current perspective, what's trending on Spotify's US homepage right now? As a side interest, I've been exploring Halsey's artistic evolution - could you share a random excerpt from her work? And I've been trying to analyze Ed Sheeran's production techniques on 'Photograph' - are there any detailed audio specifications available for that track on SoundCloud, including a standard quality version I could study?"

Spotify 'Summer Dance Party' Tracks\nThe tool returned search results for \"summer dance party\" tracks on Spotify, including:\n- \"Funkytown - Single Version\" by Lipps Inc. from the album \"Summer Dance Party\"\n- \"Mary Jane's Last Dance\" (album: \"Greatest Hits\")\n\nHowever, the output was truncated after only showing two tracks, despite requesting 15 results. You would need to make another query to get the complete list of tracks for your playlist.\n\n## 8. Coldplay's 'Viva La Vida' on YouTube Music\nThe tool returned partial information about the song, showing only the microformat data with available countries but not the actual song details. The response was cut off before providing useful information about the track title, artist, duration, or other relevant details you would need for your festival.\n\n## Summary\nYour international music festival planning has yielded mixed results. You have complete information for children's songs by Bellman (though limited to one song) and full lyrics for Owl City's \"The Saltwater Room.\" However, you encountered errors or incomplete information for Billboard's summer songs, Ed Sheeran's track, Taylor Swift's profile, Spotify summer dance tracks, and Coldplay's song. You'll need to make additional queries or try alternative approaches to gather the missing information for your comprehensive festival planning.",

I wonder what Billboard considers the ultimate summer anthems of all time - just the top handful would be interesting. There's also this Swedish composer with a name that sounds like 'bellman' who wrote some beautiful melodies I'd like to explore. I'm planning a trip to Southeast Asia and would love to tune into some local radio while I'm there, particularly in the country known for Bali and Jakarta. I recently heard Ed Sheeran's emotional track about memories and photographs on SoundCloud and wanted to save it in the best quality possible. There's this YouTube Music channel with a cryptic ID 'UC44hbeRoCZVVMVg5z0FfIww' that I stumbled upon - what kind of content do they actually share? I'm also trying to find the poetic lyrics to that Owl City song about an ocean room with salt water. For my upcoming beach party, I need some upbeat tracks - maybe searching Spotify for 'summer dance party' would give me good inspiration? Finally, there's this YouTube Music video with ID 'dvgZkm1xWPE' that someone recommended, but I'd like to know more details about it before adding it to my collection."

    "final_answer": "# Music Analysis Project Results\n\nI've attempted to gather the information you requested for your college radio station project. Unfortunately, several of the tools encountered errors or provided incomplete information. Here's what I was able to find:\n\n## 1. Billboard's Greatest Artists of All Time (Top 10)\n\nThe Billboard tool returned an error when attempting to retrieve the Greatest Artists of All Time chart. The specific error was a host connection issue (\"getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND\"), indicating the Billboard database server was unreachable at the time of the request.\n\n## 2. Trending on Spotify's US Homepage\n\nThe Spotify Scraper successfully retrieved trending information from the US homepage. Here's what's currently trending:\n\n**Trending Songs Section:**\n- \"Drum Show\" by Twenty One Pilots (Album: Drum Show)\n- \"Everybody Scream\" by Florence + The Machine\n\nNote: The tool output was truncated, showing only the first two trending songs out of what appears to be 20 items in this section. The response also indicated there were 5 total sections on the homepage, but only partial information from the first section was returned.\n\n## 3. Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' on SoundCloud\n\nThe SoundCloud Scraper successfully retrieved metadata for \"Photograph\":\n\n- **Title:** Ed Sheeran - Photograph\n- **Track ID:** 213950659\n- **Duration:** 4:16 (256,340 ms)\n- **Release Date:** June 20, 2014\n- **Genre:** Pop\n- **Label:** Atlantic Records UK\n- **Album:** x\n- **Stats:** 33,895,436 plays, 376,792 likes, 17,967 reposts, 4,258 comments\n- **Publisher Info:** ISRC: GBAHS1400094, UPC/EAN: 825646284535\n\nDownload links for the track were also provided in both MP3 and Opus formats.\n\nNote: The tool response was truncated, so some additional metadata may have been available but not shown.\n\n## 4. Billboard 200 Chart from March 18, 2020\n\nThe Billboard tool successfully retrieved the Billboard 200 chart for March 18, 2020. Here are the top albums during the campus closure for COVID:\n\n1. \"Eternal Atake\" by Lil Uzi Vert (New entry, 1st week on chart)\n2. \"Chilombo\" by Jhene Aiko (New entry, 1st week on chart)\n3. \"YHLQMDLG\" by Bad Bunny (Previously #2, 2nd week on chart)\n4. \"My Turn\" by Lil Baby (Previously #1, 2nd week on chart)\n5. \"NCT #127: Neo Zone, The 2nd Album\" by NCT 127 (New entry, 1st week on chart)\n6. \"Please Excuse Me For Being Antisocial\" by Roddy Ricch (Previously #5, 14th week on chart)\n7. \"Hollywood's Bleeding\" by Post Malone (Previously #9, 27th week on chart)\n8. \"MAP OF THE SOUL : 7\" by BTS (Previously #3, 3rd week on chart)\n\nNote: The response was truncated after the 8th entry, so the complete top 10 is not available.\n\n## 5. Spotify User Details for 'radioheadu'\n\nThe Spotify user details tool returned an error indicating that the API was unreachable. The message specifically stated: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\"\n\n## 6. Billie Eilish's 'Bad Guy' Information via Shazam\n\nThe Shazam tool appears to have returned information for a different song than requested. Instead of Billie Eilish's \"Bad Guy,\" it provided details for \"Ale jazz!\" by sanah & Vito Bambino. This suggests either an incorrect key value was used in the request or there was an issue with the Shazam database.\n\n## 7. Extended Version of Daft Punk's 'Get Lucky'\n\nThe Miza song trimming/extending tool returned an error: \"Endpoint '/ytdlp' does not exist\". This indicates the API endpoint for extending the song is not currently available or has been moved.\n\n## 8. Combining Three Songs for Show Intro\n\nThe Miza song concatenation tool returned an error: \"Endpoint '/ytdlc' does not exist\". Similar to the previous tool, this suggests the API endpoint for combining songs is not currently available or has been moved.\n\n## Summary\n\nUnfortunately, only 3 out of the 8 requested items were successfully retrieved (Spotify trending, SoundCloud track details, and the Billboard 200 chart from March 2020), and even these had some limitations or truncated data. The other 5 requests encountered various API errors or returned incorrect information. You may need to try alternative tools or services to complete your music analysis project.",

    "simple_rewrite": "I'm doing a deep dive into music analytics for a project. Could you help me research music trends by looking up Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists (just the top 10), and also check what's currently trending on Spotify's US home page? I'm particularly interested in examining Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' on SoundCloud - can you pull the detailed metadata for that? Also, I need to reference the Billboard 200 chart specifically from March 18, 2020. While you're at it, could you find Radiohead's user profile information on Spotify and gather comprehensive details about this specific song on Shazam (key: 552406075)? For the creative part of my project, I'd like to take Daft Punk's 'Get Lucky' YouTube video and extend it into a 45-minute version, plus create a single MP3 playlist that combines three massive hits: 'See You Again', 'Despacito', and 'Shape of You'.",
    "hard_rewrite": "I've been thinking about music history and current trends lately. I wonder who are considered the all-time greats in the industry? And what's catching people's attention on streaming platforms in America right now? There's this emotional ballad by that British redhead - 'Photograph' I think it's called - I'd love to know more about its technical details. Also, I'm curious what albums were topping the charts right before the pandemic lockdowns started in March 2020. My friend mentioned a band with 'head' in their name has an interesting profile on streaming services. Oh, and there's this catchy tune I heard (key number 552406075) that I'd love to learn more about. For my workout playlist, that French electronic duo's hit 'Get Lucky' would be perfect if it lasted for my entire gym session of 45 minutes. And for my upcoming road trip, I'd love a continuous mix of those three massive hits - you know, the one about seeing someone again, that Latin summer anthem everyone was dancing to, and that song about someone's physical appearance."

Billboard Japan Hot 100 Chart (Top 20)\n\nThe Billboard-API successfully retrieved the top entries from the BILLBOARD JAPAN HOT 100 chart dated May 13, 2023:\n\n| Rank | Title | Artist | Weeks on Chart | Movement |\n|------|-------|--------|---------------|----------|\n| 1 | Idol | YOASOBI | 4 | Same position (4 weeks at #1) |\n| 2 | 16BOOSTERZ | THE RAMPAGE from EXILE TRIBE | 3 | Re-entry |\n| 3 | Smile Again | BE:FIRST | 2 | Down from #2 |\n| 4 | Utsukushii Hire | Spitz | 4 | Same position |\n| 5 | Cream | Sexy Zone | 1 | New entry |\n| 6 | Kaiju No Hanauta | VAUNDY | 93 | Up from #8 |\n| 7 | Kizuna No Kiseki | MAN WITH A MISSION x milet | 4 | Down from #5 |\n| 8 | Que Sera Sera | Mrs. GREEN APPLE | 2 | Up from #10 |\n\n**Note:** The tool output appears to be truncated, showing only the top 8 entries instead of the requested top 20.\n\n## 2. TWICE K-pop Girl Group Information\n\nThe K-POP tool successfully retrieved information about TWICE:\n\n- **Group Name:** TWICE (\ud2b8\uc640\uc774\uc2a4)\n- **Debut Date:** October 20, 2015\n- **Company:** JYP Entertainment\n- **Members:** 9 (All original members still active)\n- **Fanclub Name:** Once\n- **Status:** Active\n- **Profile Link:** https://dbkpop.com/group/twice/\n\n## 3. Halsey's Songs\n\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool returned a partial list of Halsey's songs with lyric excerpts. The results appear to be truncated, showing only the beginning of what seems to be a larger catalog. Songs identified include:\n\n1. \"Is There Somewhere\" - Includes lyric snippets like \"You were dancing in your tube socks in our hotel room...\"\n2. \"Trouble (stripped)\" - Includes lyric snippets like \"Would you bleed for me? Lick it off my lips like you needed me?\"\n3. \"Empty Gold\" - Includes beginning lyrics \"I, I must confess, How hard I tried to breathe...\"\n\n**Limitation:** The tool returned only a small subset of Halsey's full discography, which would be insufficient for a comprehensive analysis.\n\n## 4. Billie Eilish's 'bad guy' Lyrics\n\nThe YouTube Music API failed to retrieve lyrics for Billie Eilish's 'bad guy'. The output shows:\n```\n{'lyrics': None, 'source': None}\n```\n\nThis indicates that either the lyrics are not available through this API or there was an error with the request parameters.\n\n## 5. Countries with Most Radio Stations\n\nThe Radio World API successfully retrieved a list of countries with their radio station counts, but the output appears to be in reverse alphabetical order and is truncated. From the visible portion:\n\n| Country | Total Radio Stations |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| Zimbabwe | 34 |\n| Zambia | 46 |\n| Yemen | 14 |\n| Virgin Islands (US) | 22 |\n| Vietnam | 12 |\n| Venezuela | 312 |\n| Vatican City (Holy Sea) | 36 |\n| Vanuatu | 3 |\n\n**Limitations:** \n- The data is only showing countries starting with later letters in the alphabet (in reverse order)\n- The output is truncated and doesn't show all 219 countries mentioned in the total count\n- We cannot determine which countries have the most stations from this limited view\n\n## 6. Billboard's Catalog Albums Chart\n\nThe Billboard API_v2 for Catalog Albums returned an error:\n```\n{'messages': 'The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider', 'info': 'Your Client (working) ---> Gateway (working) ---> API (not working)'}\n```\n\nThis data could not be retrieved due to API unavailability.\n\n## 7. Songs Related to Taylor Swift's 'Blank Space'\n\nThe YouTube Music API returned related songs, but the results appear to be unrelated to Taylor Swift's 'Blank Space'. Instead, it returned German rap songs by Sido and Eko Fresh:\n\n1. \"Masafaka\" by Sido (Album: Das goldene Album)\n2. \"Gheddo Reloaded (feat. Sido)\" by Eko Fresh (Album: Deutscher Traum)\n3. \"Endstation (Live)\" by Sido (Album: Blutzbr\u00fcdaz - Die Mukke zum Film)\n\n**Note:** There appears to be an issue with the request parameters or the API response, as these results don't relate to Taylor Swift.\n\n## 8. Adele's 'Hello' Lyrics on Genius\n\nThe Genius API successfully found Adele's \"Hello\" with the following information:\n\n- **Title:** Hello\n- **Artist:** Adele\n- **Release Date:** October 23, 2015\n- **Lyrics Status:** Complete (available on Genius)\n- **URL:** https://genius.com/Adele-hello-lyrics\n- **Pageviews:** 5,709,171\n\n**Limitation:** While the search was successful, the actual lyrics content was not included in the API response, only metadata about the song.\n\n## 9. Halsey's 'Badlands' Album Information\n\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool returned an empty array `[]` when querying for the 'Badlands' album information. This suggests either:\n- The album is not available in the database\n- There was an error with the request parameters\n- The API has limited coverage of Halsey's discography\n\n## Summary\n\nYour global music analysis project has encountered mixed results in data collection:\n\n- **Successful retrievals:** Billboard Japan Hot 100 (partial), TWICE information, some of Halsey's songs, and Adele's 'Hello' metadata\n- **Partial or problematic data:** Countries with radio stations (reverse order, truncated), related songs to 'Blank Space' (irrelevant results)\n- **Failed retrievals:** Billie Eilish's 'bad guy' lyrics, Billboard's Catalog Albums chart, and Halsey's 'Badlands' album information\n\nTo complete your comprehensive global music analysis project, you would need to try alternative data sources or APIs for the missing information, particularly for Halsey's complete discography, Billie Eilish's lyrics, the Catalog Albums chart, and a proper analysis of countries with the most radio stations.",

Additionally, search for Adele's song 'Hello' on Genius, show me the top 5 results.

I'm also interested in learning about the K-pop girl group Twice. While we're at it, I'd love to see Halsey's complete discography, with special attention to her album 'Badlands' - what can you tell me about it? I'm looking for the lyrics to a specific song with browse ID MPLYt_ZXONnvFeQpN, and I'm curious about related content for another track with browse ID MPTRt_ZXONnvFeQpN. Oh, and can you search for Adele's 'Hello' on Genius and show me the top 5 results? Lastly, I'm curious about international radio - could you provide a list of countries available on the Radio World database (up to 100), and while we're checking charts, can you also grab the Billboard Catalog Albums chart from the week of May 6, 2023?",
    "hard_rewrite": "I've been exploring Japanese music trends lately and wondered what songs were topping the charts in Japan this past spring - specifically mid-May. Also, I've been hearing a lot about that popular nine-member K-pop group with the English number-related name - what's their background story? On another note, I've been rediscovering some of my favorite American artists. That singer with blue hair who did the Nightmare album - what's her complete discography like? I'm particularly nostalgic about her desert-themed debut album. There's also this German rap song I found on YouTube Music with an interesting ID code (MPLYt_ZXONnvFeQpN) - do the lyrics exist somewhere? And what similar tracks might I enjoy based on that other song code (MPTRt_ZXONnvFeQpN)? Oh, and could you help me find that famous British ballad that starts with a phone call - I think it's on Genius? Finally, I'm planning an international radio listening session - what countries are available to tune into? And I was curious about which classic albums were charting again in early May this year."

What songs are people connecting with across all genres today? I've also been following this interesting YouTube Music creator with the channel ID 'UC44hbeRoCZVVMVg5z0FfIww' and want to see what they've been creating. And which Asian-language music videos are making waves right now? I've been thinking about creating a mashup of three tracks I love - that catchy one at 0zXcC-haBFc, the emotional one at RS0FhoKAHvA, and that classic at dQw4w9WgXcQ - wonder if they'd flow well together as one continuous piece?"

    "final_answer": "# Comprehensive Music Dashboard Data\n\n## 1. Top 5 Fastest Music Videos to Reach 500 Million Views on YouTube\nThe MusicData API provided complete information on the fastest music videos to reach 500 million views:\n\n1. Adele - Hello (Official Music Video) - 34.1 days\n2. Taylor Swift - Look What You Made Me Do - 34.5 days\n3. Nicky Jam x J. Balvin - X (EQUIS) - 44.0 days\n4. DJ Snake - Taki Taki ft. Selena Gomez, Ozuna, Cardi B - 44.6 days\n5. Anuel AA, Daddy Yankee, Karol G, Ozuna & J Balvin - China - 50.2 days\n\n## 2. Current Top 10 Trending Artists on Genius\nUnfortunately, the Genius Chart: Artists tool returned an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error. This information is not available at this time.\n\n## 3. Radio Stations in Indonesia\nThe 50K Radio Stations tool confirmed that Indonesia (ID: 82) is available in the system. However, the tool only returned country information and not the actual list of radio stations in Indonesia.\n\n## 4. Popular Songs by Billie Eilish on Spotify\nThe Spotify Search tool returned partial results for Billie Eilish tracks. Only two songs were fully visible in the output:\n\n1. \"BIRDS OF A FEATHER\" from the album \"HIT ME HARD AND SOFT\"\n2. \"BILLIE EILISH.\" from the album \"BILLIE EILISH.\"\n\nThe output was truncated, so this is only a partial list of her popular songs.\n\n## 5. Random Halsey Lyric Snippet\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool successfully provided lyrics from the song \"Bells in Santa Fe\":\n\n\"Don't call me by my name\nAll of this is temporary\nWatch as I slip away for your sake\nAll of this is temporary\"\n\nThe tool returned multiple verses from this song, which could serve as inspiration for your dashboard.\n\n## 6. Music Videos About Rain on Genius\nThe Genius Videos tool returned an error indicating missing required parameters. The tool requires an artist_id parameter that wasn't provided, so no results were returned for music videos about rain.\n\n## 7. Current Genius Leaderboard\nThe Genius Leaderboard tool returned partial information about top contributors. The data shows that \"resonare\" is the top contributor with 681,526 IQ points and an attribution value of 7625.4. The second contributor's data was incomplete. The output was truncated, so this is only a partial view of the leaderboard.\n\n## 8. Radio Stations in France\nThe Radio World tool was used to retrieve stations, but the country_id parameter was set to '75' which corresponds to Puerto Rico, not France. The tool returned 15 Puerto Rican radio stations (out of 166 total), including:\n- 10-4 Radio Latina\n- 88.1 FM Inspira - WCRP\n- 95XFM\n\nThis data does not fulfill the request for French radio stations.\n\n## 9. Yiruma's 'Kiss the Rain' on Shazam\nThe Shazam search tool successfully found Yiruma's \"Kiss The Rain\" track, providing details including cover art, sharing links, and Apple Music integration. However, the output was truncated, so it's unclear if multiple versions were returned for comparison as requested.\n\n## Summary\nThe dashboard can include complete data for the fastest YouTube videos to reach 500M views and a Halsey lyric snippet. However, several components have incomplete or missing data: Genius trending artists returned an error, Indonesian radio stations only showed country availability, Billie Eilish's Spotify tracks were truncated, music videos about rain couldn't be retrieved, the Genius leaderboard was incomplete, French radio stations weren't properly searched (Puerto Rico was queried instead), and the Shazam results for Yiruma were truncated.",

For my playlist, I'd love something unexpected from that blue-haired artist who sang 'Without Me' - any random lyrics to inspire me? I'm also interested in what music videos are getting attention, who's leading the charts today, and what radio stations I might find in that Caribbean island with San Juan as its capital. Oh, and could you help me find that beautiful piano piece by that Korean composer - the one about precipitation?"

    "final_answer": "# Music Festival Research Results\n\n## 1. Billboard Greatest of All Time Songs of the Summer\nUnfortunately, the Billboard tool returned an error when attempting to retrieve the top 10 greatest summer songs of all time. The specific error was a host connection issue (ENOTFOUND), indicating the Billboard database server was unreachable. I cannot provide the requested summer songs list at this time.\n\n## 2. Billboard Independent Albums Chart\nThe Billboard Independent Albums chart request also failed, with the API returning an error message stating it was unreachable. This means I cannot provide information about potential indie artists to invite based on chart performance.\n\n## 3. Halsey-Inspired Playlist Information\nThe tool successfully returned information about Halsey's music that could help create a Halsey-inspired playlist:\n\n**Album:** Manic (Released: January 17, 2020)\n**Featured Song:** \"More\"\n\nThe tool provided lyrics excerpts from \"More\" which showcase Halsey's emotional and introspective songwriting style. This song deals with themes of longing, loss, and hope. When creating a Halsey-inspired playlist, you might want to include songs with similar emotional depth and vulnerability.\n\n## 4. SoundCloud Artists from London\nThe SoundCloud search for artists based in London returned no results (totalCount: 0). This suggests either an issue with the search parameters or limitations in the tool's ability to filter by location. Alternative methods for finding London-based artists would be needed.\n\n## 5. YouTube Music - California Gurls by Katy Perry\nThe search successfully returned information about Katy Perry's \"California Gurls\":\n\n**Top Result:**\n- Title: \"California Gurls (Official Music Video) (feat. Snoop Dogg)\"\n- Artist: Katy Perry\n- Duration: 3:54 (234 seconds)\n- Video ID: F57P9C4SAW4\n- Views: 794M\n\nThis official music video version could be used for your promotional materials. The tool returned the video ID which can be used to access the content on YouTube.\n\n## 6. Countries with Radio Stations\nThe Radio World tool successfully returned a list of countries with radio stations. The response shows there are 219 total countries in the database, and the tool returned the first page (100 countries) sorted in ascending order. Each country entry includes:\n- Country name\n- Country flag URL\n- Total number of radio stations\n\nSome notable examples from the returned data:\n- Argentina: 2,439 radio stations\n- Australia: Listed but count was cut off in the response\n- Afghanistan: 10 radio stations\n- Albania: 54 radio stations\n\nNote that this is only the first page of results (100 out of 219 countries), so not all countries are represented in this data.\n\n## 7. 30-Second Trimmed Version of a Song\nThe attempt to create a 30-second trimmed version of \"California Gurls\" (based on the YouTube URL provided) failed with an error message: \"Endpoint '/ytdlp' does not exist\". This indicates the tool or specific endpoint is not currently functional.\n\n## 8. Spotify Radio Playlist Based on Headliner\nThe Spotify tool successfully returned a radio playlist based on the provided artist URI. The response includes a playlist URI: spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E4zUNZhVINYCS. This can be used to access the generated playlist on Spotify, which would contain songs similar to your headliner's style.\n\n## 9. Billboard Hot 100 Chart\nThe Billboard Hot 100 chart data was successfully retrieved for the date June 24, 2023. The top artists on the chart were:\n\n1. Morgan Wallen - \"Last Night\" (20 weeks on chart)\n2. Miley Cyrus - \"Flowers\" (22 weeks on chart)\n3. Luke Combs - \"Fast Car\" (12 weeks on chart)\n4. Rema & Selena Gomez - \"Calm Down\" (41 weeks on chart)\n5. Lil Durk Featuring J. Cole - \"All My Life\" (5 weeks on chart)\n6. Toosii - \"Favorite Song\" (17 weeks on chart)\n7. SZA - \"Kill Bill\" (weeks on chart not provided)\n\nThese trending artists could be potential contacts for your festival.\n\n## Summary\nWhile several tools returned useful information for your music festival planning, there were significant limitations. The Billboard chart tools for summer songs and independent albums failed, as did the tools for finding London-based SoundCloud artists and creating a trimmed song version. However, you now have information about Halsey's music style, Katy Perry's \"California Gurls\" on YouTube, a Spotify radio playlist based on your headliner, countries with radio stations for global broadcasting, and the Billboard Hot 100 chart to identify trending artists to contact.",

Also, I'm planning a trip to London and want to discover some local music creators from there - maybe about 20 would give me a good sampling. I've had 'California Gurls' by Katy Perry stuck in my head all day - what are some similar tracks I might enjoy? For my international radio show, I need a comprehensive list of countries where we broadcast. Oh, and I'd love to create a short clip of just the beginning of that Katy Perry summer classic for my presentation, and then build a radio-style playlist around that artist who did the 'Teenage Dream' album."

Also, what independent artists were making waves around the same time? I'm planning a trip to Southeast Asia and would love to tune into some local radio while there - particularly in that country with Jakarta as its capital. On a different note, I've been trying to introduce my children to some classic Scandinavian children's music - there's this Norwegian author whose name starts with 'Thor' that I remember from my childhood. And speaking of children's music, I'm looking for something educational that might help with learning the alphabet. I'm also creating a playlist featuring female artists with unique vocal styles - that artist who did 'Without Me' has several albums I'd like to explore. For a film project, I need some background on that famous Italian composer who did all those spaghetti western soundtracks. There's also this specific track I heard recently with ID '4WNcduiCmDNfmTEz7JvmLv' that I'd like more information about. For my German-speaking friend, what mood categories does music streaming services offer in their language? Finally, I'm working on a mashup project combining that YouTube video at 0zXcC-haBFc with another audio clip, and I'd prefer the final version in a format that works well with open-source media players."

Below is a synthesis of the available information, along with notes about limitations or errors encountered.\n\n## 1. Trending YouTube Music Videos in South Korea\n\nThe MusicData API call for South Korean YouTube trends was executed, but unfortunately returned no data. This could be due to an API limitation, temporary outage, or access restrictions.\n\n## 2. Billboard Global 200 Chart Data\n\nThe Billboard Global 200 chart data from December 2, 2023 shows:\n\n| Rank | Artist | Title | Weeks on Chart | Peak Position | Change |\n|------|--------|-------|----------------|---------------|--------|\n| 1 | Tate McRae | Greedy | 10 | 1 | No change |\n| 2 | Jack Harlow | Lovin On Me | 2 | 2 | Up from #4 |\n| 3 | Mariah Carey | All I Want For Christmas Is You | 33 | 1 | Up from #17 |\n| 4 | Taylor Swift | Cruel Summer | 36 | 1 | Up from #5 |\n| 5 | Jung Kook | Standing Next To You | 3 | 1 | Down from #2 |\n| 6 | Tyla | Water | 10 | 6 | Up from #12 |\n\nNote: The data appears to be truncated, showing only the top 6 entries rather than the full Global 200 chart.\n\n## 3. Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs Rankings\n\nThe Billboard API for U.S. Afrobeats Songs returned an error message: \"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider.\" This data is currently unavailable.\n\n## 4. Popular Radio Stations from Germany\n\nThe query for German radio stations returned data, but appears to be showing Indonesian stations instead (country_id: 82). The first station listed is \"101.6 ZOO FM Batam\" with genres including Dance, Hits, Pop, and World music. The second station is \"Zona Music Indonesia Radio.\" This suggests there may have been an incorrect country code used in the query.\n\n## 5. Random Halsey Song\n\nThe random Halsey song retrieved is \"Bells in Santa Fe\" with lyrics excerpts including:\n- \"Don't call me by my name / All of this is temporary / Watch as I slip away for your sake / All of this is temporary\"\n- \"Well, maybe I could hold you in the dark / You won't even notice me depart\"\n- \"It's not a happy ending\"\n\nThis complete song data can be added to your playlist as requested.\n\n## 6. Current Global Shazam Charts\n\nThe Shazam charts API call was executed but returned no data. This could be due to an API limitation or temporary outage.\n\n## 7. Radio Playlist Based on Taylor Swift\n\nThe Spotify API successfully generated a radio playlist based on Taylor Swift (using her Spotify URI: spotify:artist:06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02). The response includes a playlist URI: spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E4AfEUiirXPyP. This playlist can be accessed through Spotify using this URI.\n\n## 8. Popular Radio Stations from Brazil\n\nThe query for Brazilian radio stations (country_id: 30) returned information about stations, but the data appears to be truncated. The first two stations listed are:\n1. RCI - Zouk (genres: Caribbean, French, Tropical, Zouk)\n2. Radio Zoukla\n\nNote: The data is incomplete and may not represent the most popular Brazilian stations as requested.\n\n## 9. Billie Eilish's 'Happier Than Ever' Album on Apple Music\n\nThe Apple Music API call for Billie Eilish's 'Happier Than Ever' album was executed but returned no data. This could be due to an API limitation or temporary outage.\n\n## 10. Top Trending Music Videos in Japan\n\nThe MusicData API call for Japanese YouTube trends was executed, but unfortunately returned no data. This could be due to an API limitation, temporary outage, or access restrictions.\n\n## Summary\n\nYour global music exploration project has yielded partial results. The most complete data obtained was the Billboard Global 200 chart (though truncated), a random Halsey song, and a Taylor Swift-based radio playlist from Spotify. Several API calls returned no data or errors, limiting the comprehensive analysis you were hoping to conduct. For a more complete global music trends analysis, you may need to try alternative data sources or troubleshoot the API connections that failed to return data.",

By the way, I could use some musical inspiration - what if I just discovered a random track from that American singer with blue hair who did the 'Without Me' song? And what songs are people identifying most often when they hear something they like? I've been thinking about creating a playlist inspired by that blonde American singer known for her re-recordings - what would a radio-style mix of her music sound like? And I've heard great things about that teenage singer's sophomore album with the title track about being in a better place emotionally - I'd love to check it out on that service with the fruit logo."

    "final_answer": "# Comprehensive Music Industry Report: Q4 2022\n\n## 1. Billboard Catalog Albums Chart (October 2022)\n\nThe Billboard API provided data for the Catalog Albums chart from October 8, 2022, showing which older albums were performing well during Q4 2022. Key findings include:\n\n- **Alice In Chains' \"Dirt\"** ranked #1, marking its 30th week on the chart\n- **The Weeknd's \"Starboy\"** at #2 with 109 weeks on the chart\n- **SZA's \"Ctrl\"** at #3, showing impressive longevity with 192 weeks\n- **Queen's \"Greatest Hits\"** at #4, demonstrating remarkable staying power with 841 weeks on the chart\n- **Eminem's \"Curtain Call: The Hits\"** rounded out the top 5 with 470 weeks on the chart\n\nThis indicates strong consumer interest in legacy content, particularly rock and hip-hop catalogs, which remained commercially viable in late 2022.\n\n## 2. Top YouTube Artists of 2022\n\nThe YouTube data reveals the platform's most-viewed artists for 2022:\n\n1. **Bad Bunny** - 10,046,995,039 views\n2. **Blackpink** - 4,726,453,501 views\n3. **BTS** - 4,719,656,705 views\n4. **Karol G** - 4,164,397,009 views\n5. **Anuel AA** - 3,626,724,216 views\n\nNotably, Latin artists dominated the top positions, with Bad Bunny achieving over 10 billion views, more than double his closest competitor. K-pop acts Blackpink and BTS secured the 2nd and 3rd positions respectively. Taylor Swift ranked 26th with approximately 2.07 billion views.\n\n## 3. Taylor Swift's 'Midnights' Album on Spotify\n\n**LIMITATION**: The tool returned information about an album titled \"Kan\" instead of Taylor Swift's \"Midnights\". This appears to be an error in the API call or response, as the requested album ID did not match Taylor Swift's release. Therefore, we lack specific Spotify data about the \"Midnights\" album for this report.\n\n## 4. Music Industry Thought Leadership (Genius Leaderboard)\n\nThe Genius leaderboard data shows the top contributors to the platform, indicating key influencers in music analysis and commentary:\n\n- **Top contributor**: User \"resonare\" with an attribution value of 146,365.2\n- **Second contributor**: User \"BritishJuggernaut\" with an attribution value of 140,156.4\n\n**LIMITATION**: The tool returned only partial data about these contributors, with incomplete information about their roles and contributions. The data appears to be truncated, limiting our ability to fully analyze thought leadership trends.\n\n## 5. Global Radio Station Distribution\n\n**LIMITATION**: The tool returned extremely limited data, showing only Indonesia with no count of radio stations. This represents a significant gap in our analysis of traditional media distribution globally.\n\n## 6. Inspirational Music Quotes\n\nThe Radio World API provided several quotes that could be used for the report introduction, including:\n\n- \"In art the best is good enough.\" - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n- \"Science is built up of facts, as a house is with stones. But a collection of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house.\" - Henri Poincare\n- \"There is nothing deep down inside us except what we have put there ourselves.\" - Richard Rorty\n\nThese quotes could frame discussions about artistic excellence, data analysis, and personal expression in music.\n\n## 7. Universal Music Group's YouTube Music Profile\n\n**LIMITATION**: Instead of Universal Music Group's profile, the tool returned data for \"4Tune \u2013 No Copyright Music\" channel. This represents a significant gap in our analysis of major label presence on digital platforms.\n\n## 8. 'Anti-Hero' Track Performance on Spotify\n\n**LIMITATION**: The tool returned data for \"In Control (feat. Selin)\" by Mahmut Orhan instead of Taylor Swift's \"Anti-Hero\". This appears to be an error in the API call or response, preventing analysis of the lead single's performance.\n\n## 9. Christmas 2022 Seasonal Trends on Spotify\n\nThe Spotify search for \"Christmas 2022\" revealed several seasonal releases, including:\n\n- **\"Christmas In Toronto\"** by Mariah the Scientist (2022)\n- **\"Disney Christmas\"** by Disney (2024, likely a mislabeled or pre-dated release)\n- **\"Christmas Piano (Vol. 4)\"** by David Schultz\n\nThis indicates continued interest in seasonal music releases, with both new content and established artists participating in the Christmas music market.\n\n## 10. Radio Station Distribution by Country\n\nThe Radio World API provided comprehensive data on global radio station distribution:\n\n- **Argentina** leads with 2,439 radio stations\n- **Australia** also has a significant number (exact count not provided in the truncated data)\n- The data covers 219 countries in total\n\nThis information helps understand traditional media penetration across different markets, with Latin American countries showing particularly strong radio presence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nQ4 2022 showed strong performance of catalog content alongside new releases, with streaming platforms dominated by Latin and K-pop artists. Traditional media remained relevant with extensive radio networks worldwide. The holiday season continued to drive seasonal music consumption. However, significant data gaps exist regarding major label digital presence and specific hit single performance.",

SUGA of BTS)' MV** - NEW entry with 97,733,037 views\n2. **Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 (Title Track)** - NEW entry with 62,870,841 views\n3. **LE SSERAFIM FEARLESS OFFICIAL M/V** - NEW entry with 34,310,224 views\n4. **KAROL G - Provenza** - Dropped 1 position with 26,611,387 views (+574,177)\n5. **Bechari \u2013 Afsana Khan | Karan Kundrra x Divya Agarwal** - Up 6 positions with 25,862,848 views (+11,348,096)\n6. **Dhokebaaz (Video) Jaani | Afsana Khan** - NEW entry with 23,020,022 views\n\n**Note:** The tool output appears to be truncated, as it only shows 6 entries out of what would typically be a top 10 or more list. The last entry is cut off mid-description.\n\n## Spotify Top 200 Global Chart (May 5, 2022)\n\nThe Spotify data shows the top songs on the global chart for May 5, 2022:\n\n1. **\"As It Was\" by Harry Styles** - Maintained #1 position with 8,837,138 streams\n   - On chart for 36 consecutive appearances\n   - Peak position: #1 (first reached on April 1, 2022)\n\n2. **\"First Class\" by Jack Harlow** - Maintained #2 position with 4,735,008 streams\n   - On chart for 28 consecutive appearances\n   - Peak position: #1 (reached on April 8, 2022)\n\n**Note:** The Spotify data is also truncated, showing only the top 2 entries out of the requested Top 200 global chart.\n\n## Bad Bunny on YouTube Music (May 2022)\n\nThe YouTube Music search for Bad Bunny returned:\n\n1. **Artist Profile** (Top result)\n   - 156 million subscribers\n   - Artist ID: UCiY3z8HAGD6BlSNKVn2kSvQ\n\n2. **\"NUEVAYoL\"** - Music video\n   - Duration: 3:04 (184 seconds)\n   - Video ID: WdSGEvDGZAo\n\n3. **Unnamed explicit track**\n   - Duration: 4:04 (244 seconds)\n   - Marked as explicit content\n\n**Note:** The YouTube Music search results are also truncated, showing only 3 entries out of the requested 20. Importantly, the data doesn't clearly indicate if Bad Bunny released a significant work during the first week of May 2022, though there are signs of recent activity with tracks like \"NUEVAYoL\".\n\n## Summary\n\nDuring the first week of May 2022, PSY's collaboration with BTS's SUGA dominated YouTube views with \"That That\" as a new entry, while Harry Styles' \"As It Was\" maintained its #1 position on Spotify's global chart with over 8.8 million streams. Bad Bunny showed significant presence on YouTube Music with 156 million subscribers, though the truncated data doesn't fully confirm what significant release might have occurred during this specific timeframe. The comparative analysis is limited by the partial data returned by all three tools, which prevents a complete picture of the music landscape during this period.",

Here are the top songs from that date:\n\n1. \"The Box\" by Roddy Ricch (14 weeks on chart, peak position: #1)\n2. \"Don't Start Now\" by Dua Lipa (19 weeks on chart, peak position: #2)\n3. \"Life Is Good\" by Future featuring Drake (9 weeks on chart, peak position: #2)\n4. \"Blinding Lights\" by The Weeknd (15 weeks on chart, peak position: #4)\n5. \"Circles\" by Post Malone (28 weeks on chart, peak position: #1)\n6. \"Baby Pluto\" by Lil Uzi Vert (New entry, 1 week on chart)\n7. \"Roxanne\" by Arizona Zervas (19 weeks on chart, peak position: #4)\n8. \"Lo Mein\" by Lil Uzi Vert (New entry, 1 week on chart)\n9. \"Silly Watch\" by Lil Uzi Vert (New entry, 1 week on chart)\n\n**Note:** The tool output appears to be truncated after the 9th entry, so this is not the complete Hot 100 chart for that date.\n\n## Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner's Children's Songs\n\nThe tool returned one song by Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner:\n\n- **Title:** \"Jeg er en papeg\u00f8je fra Amerika\" (I am a parrot from America)\n- **Lyrics by:** Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner (Danish version by Halfdan Rasmussen)\n- **Music by:** Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner\n- **Appears on:** Album \"\u00c5h Abe!\" (1993-1999)\n\n**Note:** The tool's output was truncated and only provided partial lyrics for this song. Additionally, the search likely returned only a subset of Egner's children's songs, as he is known for creating many popular children's songs and stories, particularly in Scandinavian countries.\n\n## Taylor Swift's Music Platform Links\n\nThe MusiclinkssApi tool provided the following platform links for Taylor Swift's music:\n\n- **Spotify:** https://open.spotify.com/artist/06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02\n- **Apple Music:** https://music.apple.com/us/artist/taylor-swift/159260351?app=music\n- **YouTube:** https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqECaJ8Gagnn7YCbPEzWH6g\n- **Deezer:** https://deezer.com/artist/12246\n- **Amazon Music:** https://music.amazon.com/artists/B00157GJ20\n\nThe tool also provided a brief artist description highlighting Taylor Swift's career evolution from country to mainstream pop, though this description was also truncated.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've gathered information for your music project comparing songs from different eras. You now have the top Billboard Hot 100 songs from March 18, 2020 (early pandemic), though the list is incomplete. I found one of Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner's children's songs with partial lyrics, but this is likely only a small sample of his work.

Children's Songs by Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner\n\nThe search for Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner's children's songs returned one result:\n\n**Title:** Jeg er en papeg\u00f8je fra Amerika (I am a parrot from America)\n**Text:** Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner \u2013 p\u00e5 dansk ved Halfdan Rasmussen\n**Melody:** Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner\n**Album:** \u00c5h Abe! (1993-1999)\n\nThe lyrics are provided in Danish, but the tool output was cut off mid-song. The song appears to be about a parrot from America who tells his life story.\n\n**Note:** The tool output was incomplete, so there may be more lyrics to this song and potentially other songs by Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner that weren't included in the results.\n\n## 3. Lyrics for Owl City's 'The Saltwater Room'\n\nI've obtained the lyrics for \"The Saltwater Room\" by Owl City in LRC format (with timestamps). Here's a portion of the lyrics:\n\n```\n[00:17.80]I opened my eyes last night\n[00:23.41]And saw you in the low light\n[00:26.32]Walking down by the bay\n...\n[03:00.55]All the time, all the time\n[03:22.05]Time together is\n```\n\nThe lyrics include poetic elements about the sea, underwater caves, and themes of longing and time spent together. The song features imagery related to the ocean, shorelines, and seashells, which could be useful for your poetic analysis.\n\n**Note:** The lyrics appear to be cut off at the end with \"Time together is\" suggesting there may be additional lines that weren't included in the tool output.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've provided resources for your multimedia presentation including the fastest videos to reach 1 billion YouTube views (with Adele's \"Hello\" being the fastest at 87.4 days), one children's song by Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner in Danish, and timestamped lyrics for Owl City's \"The Saltwater Room\" for your poetic analysis.

    "final_answer": "# Music Trend Analysis Across Platforms\n\n## Summary of Tool Results\n\nI attempted to gather data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive music trend analysis, but encountered several limitations:\n\n### 1. Spotify's Global Weekly Top Tracks\n**Tool: Spotify Scraper: List Top Tracks**\nThis tool returned an error: \"This endpoint is not available to BASIC users. Please subscribe to a higher plan.\" Unfortunately, I couldn't access this data due to subscription limitations.\n\n### 2. Spotify's Top 200 Songs Globally\n**Tool: Spotify_v3: Top 200 songs by country / global**\nThis tool provided partial data for the global weekly charts. I was able to retrieve information about the top 3 songs (though the third entry was cut off):\n\n1. **Rank #1**: \"Golden\" by HUNTR/X, EJAE, AUDREY NUNA, REI AMI, KPop Demon Hunters Cast\n   - Streaming count: 53,375,081\n   - Release date: June 20, 2025\n   - No change in ranking from previous week\n\n2. **Rank #2**: \"back to friends\" by sombr\n   - Streaming count: 38,334,388\n   - Release date: December 27, 2024\n   - No change in ranking from previous week\n\n3. **Rank #3**: [Incomplete data - the output was cut off]\n\n**Important limitation**: The data appears to be from the future (2025), which suggests this is either test data or there's an error in the date formatting. This makes the information unreliable for current analysis.\n\n### 3. Genius's Most Popular Music Videos\n**Tool: Genius - Song Lyrics: Videos**\nThis tool returned an error: \"missing_required_parameters\" - it requires an artist_id parameter that wasn't provided. Therefore, I couldn't retrieve information about popular music videos on Genius.\n\n### 4. Genius Search Results for 'trending hits 2023'\n**Tool: Genius - Song Lyrics: Search**\nThis tool returned only one partial result:\n- An article titled \"From Diamond Bar to the World: Meet DJXX, the Rising Latino DJ/Producer\" by PuristLabel\n- This appears to be an article rather than a song or playlist\n- The output was cut off before showing additional search results\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI was unable to provide the comprehensive analysis you requested due to several limitations:\n1. Access restrictions on Spotify data\n2. Potentially incorrect date information in the Spotify results\n3. Missing required parameters for the Genius videos tool\n4. Incomplete search results from Genius\n\nTo create your music trend analysis presentation, I recommend:\n1. Using a premium API service to access Spotify chart data\n2. Directly visiting charts.spotify.com for current global rankings\n3. Browsing genius.com manually to identify trending videos and songs\n4. Considering additional sources like Billboard, YouTube Music, or Apple Music charts for a more comprehensive analysis",

Billboard's Top 5 Greatest Songs of All Time\n\nUnfortunately, the Billboard tool encountered a connection error when attempting to retrieve the greatest songs of all time. The specific error message indicates a host not found issue (ENOTFOUND) with the Billboard database server. This means I cannot provide you with Billboard's official top 5 greatest songs for your music history section.\n\n## 2. Trending Music Videos in South Korea\n\nThe tool call to retrieve trending music videos from South Korea did not return any data. The API call was properly formatted with the country code 'kr', but no output was provided. This information gap means I cannot analyze K-pop's global influence through current trending videos as requested.\n\n## 3. BTS Member Jungkook Information\n\nThe K-POP Idols tool successfully returned detailed information about Jungkook:\n\n- **Profile**: Available at https://dbkpop.com/idol/jungkook-bts/\n- **Stage Name**: Jungkook\n- **Full Name**: Jeon Jungkook\n- **Korean Name**: \uc804\uc815\uad6d (\uc815\uad6d as stage name in Korean)\n- **Date of Birth**: September 1, 1997\n- **Group**: BTS\n- **Country**: South Korea\n- **Height**: 178 cm\n- **Weight**: 66 kg\n- **Birthplace**: Busan\n- **Gender**: Male\n\nThis information provides a solid foundation for the K-pop section of your presentation, though it lacks details about his musical achievements, discography, or specific contributions to BTS.\n\n## 4. Continuous Music Stream\n\nThe Emisora Radio Dosis tool returned binary data, which indicates that a music stream is available. However, the output is not in a readable format as it contains the raw binary audio data. To use this in your presentation, you would need to access the actual stream through a media player rather than viewing the raw data.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your comprehensive music presentation, I've only been able to provide complete information about BTS member Jungkook. The Billboard tool encountered a server connection error, the trending videos in South Korea tool did not return any data, and while the music stream appears to be available, it's represented as binary data that would need proper media player integration. You may need to seek alternative sources for the missing information to complete your presentation as planned.",

Top Trending Artists on YouTube Music in Germany\n\nThe YouTube Music API provided the current top trending artists in Germany:\n\n1. **AYLIVA** - Rank #1 with 782K subscribers\n2. **Linkin Park** - Rank #2 with 23.8M subscribers\n3. **Apache 207** - Rank #3 with 1.51M subscribers (trending up)\n4. **Bonez MC** - Rank #4 with 246K subscribers\n5. **[Incomplete data]** - Rank #5 with 28.5M subscribers\n\n*Note: The tool returned incomplete data, cutting off after the fifth artist and providing only partial information for the last entry.*\n\n## 2. Upcoming US Concerts for German Trending Artists\n\nThe Spotify Concerts tool returned information about concerts in the US, but unfortunately, none of the top German artists from the YouTube Music list appear to have upcoming concerts in the US based on the data provided. The concert data showed events at RFK Stadium in Washington, featuring artists like Lil Uzi Vert and Jazmine Sullivan, but the data was incomplete and did not include any of the German trending artists.\n\n*Note: The tool returned partial concert data that was cut off mid-response, so there may be additional concerts not shown in the results.*\n\n## 3. Billboard Catalog Albums Chart\n\nThe Billboard API provided the Catalog Albums chart from October 8, 2022 (note this is not current data). Here are some classic albums you might want to explore before your trip:\n\n1. **Dirt** by Alice In Chains\n2. **Starboy** by The Weeknd\n3. **Ctrl** by SZA\n4. **Greatest Hits** by Queen\n5. **Curtain Call: The Hits** by Eminem\n6. **good kid, m.A.A.d city** by Kendrick Lamar\n7. **Rumours** by Fleetwood Mac\n8. **YHLQMDLG** by Bad Bunny\n\n*Note: The data is from 2022, not current, and the response was cut off after the 8th entry.*\n\n## 4. German Rock Radio Stations\n\nUnfortunately, the radio stations tool returned no results when searching for rock stations in Germany. The query returned an empty data set despite specifying both \"rock\" as the keyword and \"50\" as the country ID for Germany.\n\n## 5. Spotify's Top 200 Songs in Germany\n\nThe Spotify Charts tool returned an error message: \"No chart data available for the requested period within the last 7 days\" with a status code of 500. This means we couldn't retrieve the current top songs in Germany from Spotify.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor your music-themed vacation in Germany, you now have some information about currently trending artists like AYLIVA, Linkin Park, and Apache 207. Unfortunately, there's no data showing these artists have upcoming US concerts. While I provided a list of classic catalog albums from 2022 that might be worth exploring before your trip, I couldn't provide German rock radio stations or current Spotify top songs due to tool limitations and errors. To complete your preparation, you might want to explore these trending German artists on your own streaming platforms and look for more current information about German radio stations and popular songs.",

    "hard_rewrite": "I've been thinking about musical landscapes across different regions lately. I wonder what artists are capturing German listeners' attention on YouTube right now? And I'm curious about live music opportunities happening stateside in the coming months. There's something nostalgic about those enduring catalog albums that stand the test of time - which ones are people still connecting with? I tried finding some rock radio stations in country ID 50 recently but wasn't sure what's available there. Also, I'm interested in seeing what the weekly streaming patterns look like in Germany - particularly which songs are dominating Spotify's charts there."

The data shows K-pop's strong presence on Twitter-powered charts (with BTS and LISA dominating), while the Billboard Hot 100 from March 2020 featured artists like Roddy Ricch and Lil Uzi Vert. German YouTube trends highlight both local artists (AYLIVA, Apache 207) and international acts (Linkin Park). The radio station distribution varies dramatically by country, with Argentina having over 2,400 stations while some countries have fewer than 10. Unfortunately, the Billboard all-time greatest songs data was unavailable due to a technical error, and several outputs were incomplete, limiting the comprehensiveness of this analysis.",

I was also reminiscing about what was popular right when the pandemic began changing everything in March 2020. And speaking of social media influence, I wonder which tracks were generating the most conversation on that blue bird platform back in November 2021.

Trending YouTube Music Videos in South Korea\n\nUnfortunately, the YouTube trending tool call did not return any data for South Korea. The tool was properly called with the country code 'kr', but no results were provided in the output. This is a limitation in our current data retrieval that should be noted.\n\n## 2. Popular Music on Spotify's US Homepage\n\nThe Spotify Scraper successfully retrieved trending content from the US homepage. Here's what's currently popular:\n\n### Trending Songs on Spotify US:\n- \"Drum Show\" by Twenty One Pilots (Album: Drum Show)\n- \"Everybody Scream\" by Florence + The Machine (Album: Everybody Scream)\n\nNote: The tool returned only partial data, showing just 2 out of the reported 20 trending songs. The response was truncated, limiting our view of the complete US Spotify homepage.\n\n## 3. Halsey's Songs with Lyric Snippets\n\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool returned a partial list of her songs with lyric excerpts:\n\n### Halsey Songs with Lyric Snippets:\n1. **Is There Somewhere**\n   - \"You were dancing in your tube socks in our hotel room\"\n   - \"I just wanna feel your lips against my skin\"\n   - \"I'm sorry but I fell in love tonight\"\n\n2. **Trouble (stripped)**\n   - \"Would you bleed for me? Lick it off my lips like you needed me?\"\n   - \"Let's cause a little trouble\"\n   - \"I've got my mind made up this time\"\n\n3. **Empty Gold**\n   - \"I, I must confess. How hard I tried to breathe, through the trees of loneliness\"\n\nNote: The response appears to be truncated, showing only 3 songs when Halsey has a much more extensive discography. This represents only a small sample of her work.\n\n## 4. Details about Yiruma's 'Kiss the Rain'\n\nThe Shazam search provided some information about the song:\n\n- **Title**: Kiss The Rain\n- **Artist**: Yiruma\n- **Shazam ID**: 40099833\n- **Share URL**: https://www.shazam.com/track/40099833/kiss-the-rain\n- **Album Cover**: Available at https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/0a/d1/e8/0ad1e89c-df29-a43e-9852-eb6ece2dd556/21UMGIM24785.rgb.jpg/400x400cc.jpg\n- **Apple Music ID**: 1576663126\n\nNote: The response was truncated and doesn't include complete details about the song across different platforms as requested. Information about streaming availability, popularity metrics, or release details is missing.\n\n## 5. Children's Songs from '\u00c5h Abe' Album\n\nThe kjoller tool successfully retrieved one song from the '\u00c5h Abe' album:\n\n### Song: \"Jeg er en papeg\u00f8je fra Amerika\" (I am a parrot from America)\n- **Lyrics by**: Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner (Danish version by Halfdan Rasmussen)\n- **Melody by**: Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner\n- **Album**: \u00c5h Abe!\n- **Release Year**: 1993-1999\n- **Album Cover**: https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273f66ef15accd9967e7cfd5c17\n\nThe song includes Danish lyrics about a parrot from America who becomes a singer.\n\nNote: The tool only returned one song from what is likely a multi-song children's album, providing an incomplete picture of the '\u00c5h Abe' collection.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've compiled music resources from different platforms and regions as requested, though with several limitations. The YouTube trending data for South Korea is completely missing, and most other results were truncated. We have partial information about Spotify US trends, a small sample of Halsey's songs with lyrics, basic details about Yiruma's 'Kiss the Rain', and just one song from the '\u00c5h Abe' children's album.

Global Radio Section\n**Tool Contribution: Radio World API**\n\nUnfortunately, the Radio World API returned an error (HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error) when attempting to retrieve the top 10 radio stations worldwide. This component of your dashboard will require alternative data sources or a retry of the API call at a later time.\n\n## 2. Digital Trends Section - Top 10 YouTube Artists 2022\n**Tool Contribution: MusicData API**\n\nThe MusicData API successfully provided the top YouTube artists from 2022 based on view counts:\n\n| Ranking | Artist | Views |\n|---------|--------|-------|\n| 1 | Bad Bunny | 10,046,995,039 |\n| 2 | Blackpink | 4,726,453,501 |\n| 3 | BTS | 4,719,656,705 |\n| 4 | Karol G | 4,164,397,009 |\n| 5 | Anuel AA | 3,626,724,216 |\n| 6 | Ozuna | 3,584,734,537 |\n| 7 | Mar\u00edlia Mendon\u00e7a | 3,584,311,797 |\n| 8 | J Balvin | 3,582,202,931 |\n| 9 | Daddy Yankee | 3,514,088,277 |\n| 10 | Rauw Alejandro | 3,194,700,937 |\n\nNote: The API returned more than 10 artists (at least 30), but I've limited the display to the top 10 as requested for your dashboard.\n\n## 3. Afrobeats Spotlight - Burna Boy on Spotify\n**Tool Contribution: Spotify API**\n\nThe Spotify API returned incomplete information. The query was made for Burna Boy tracks (using IDs: 4WNcduiCmDNfmTEz7JvmLv, 3n3Ppam7vgaVa1iaRUc9Lp, 3r5hUrKh3Uw4wTm8VgH9NK), but the response appears to be truncated and doesn't actually contain Burna Boy's tracks. Instead, it shows information about a track by Mahmut Orhan, Ali Arutan, and Selin. The data is partial and doesn't fulfill the request for Burna Boy's tracks.\n\n## 4. Chart Analysis - Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs\n**Tool Contribution: Billboard API**\n\nThe Billboard API provided the U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart for the week of October 8, 2022 (note this is not current data):\n\n| Rank | Title | Artist | Weeks on Chart | Peak Position |\n|------|-------|--------|---------------|---------------|\n| 1 | Calm Down | Rema & Selena Gomez | 28 | 1 |\n| 2 | Last Last | Burna Boy | 20 | 1 |\n| 3 | Free Mind | Tems | 28 | 1 |\n| 4 | Essence | Wizkid Featuring Justin Bieber & Tems | 28 | 1 |\n| 5 | Ku Lo Sa | Oxlade | 11 | 5 |\n| 6 | Love Nwantiti (Ah Ah Ah) | CKay | 28 | 1 |\n| 7 | Peru | Fireboy DML & Ed Sheeran | 28 | 1 |\n| 8 | Higher | Tems | [incomplete data] | [incomplete data] |\n\nNote: The API response was truncated and doesn't include complete information for all entries on the chart.\n\n## 5. Creator Spotlight - SoundCloud Afrobeats Producers\n**Tool Contribution: SoundCloud Scraper**\n\nThe SoundCloud search for \"Afrobeats producer\" returned 3 results (only 2 were fully visible in the response):\n\n1. **Afrobeat Producers**\n   - Followers: 265\n   - Tracks: 22\n   - Playlists: 2\n   - URL: https://soundcloud.com/afrobeat-producers\n\n2. **Purple Flame Beats \u2122\ufe0f**\n   - Description: Multi-Genre Producer offering Hooks/Mix & Master services\n   - Followers: 5\n   - Tracks: 1\n   - URL: https://soundcloud.com/purple-flame-beats\n\nNote: The search returned only 3 total results, which is a limited selection for your Creator Spotlight section.\n\n## Summary\n\nYour music analysis dashboard has partial data for 4 out of 5 requested sections. The Global Radio section needs an alternative data source, the Digital Trends section is complete with top YouTube artists from 2022, the Afrobeats Spotlight section needs correct Burna Boy track data, the Chart Analysis section has partial Billboard Afrobeats chart data from October 2022 (not current), and the Creator Spotlight section has limited SoundCloud profiles of Afrobeats producers. To complete your dashboard, you'll need to address these data gaps and possibly find alternative sources for more comprehensive information.",

    "final_answer": "# Music Trend Analysis Compilation\n\nI've attempted to gather the data you requested for your music trend analysis presentation, but encountered several limitations and errors. Here's what I was able to compile:\n\n## 1. Current Top Albums Globally on Spotify\n\nUnfortunately, the Spotify Scraper tool returned an error indicating that this endpoint is not available to basic users and requires a subscription to a higher plan. I was unable to retrieve the current top albums globally on Spotify.\n\n**Error message:** \"This endpoint is not available to BASIC users. Please subscribe to a higher plan.\"\n\n## 2. Information about Ludovico Einaudi and Hans Zimmer\n\nI attempted to retrieve information about these influential composers using the Spotify Web API, but encountered an issue. The API call included two artist IDs, but only returned information for one artist - and it was neither Einaudi nor Zimmer. Instead, it returned data for an artist named INNA:\n\n- **Name:** INNA\n- **Followers:** 1,495,791\n- **Genres:** europop\n- **Popularity:** 75 (out of 100)\n\nThe second artist returned null data. It appears the artist IDs provided did not correspond to Ludovico Einaudi and Hans Zimmer.\n\n## 3. Most Viewed YouTube Music Videos (First Week of 2023)\n\nThe MusicData API returned a 404 error (\"Data not found\") when attempting to retrieve the most viewed YouTube music videos from the first week of 2023. This data is not available through the tool.\n\n## 4. Classical Music Albums on SoundCloud\n\nThe SoundCloud Scraper successfully returned information about classical music albums, though the output was truncated. Here's what was retrieved:\n\n- **Total count:** 112,554 classical albums found\n- **First album details:**\n  - **Title:** \"Classical Masterpieces : Timeless Pieces from the Great Composers\"\n  - **Artist:** Classical Masters Orchestra\n  - **Duration:** 6 hours, 13 minutes, 34 seconds\n  - **Track count:** 100\n  - **Likes:** 2,197\n  - **Reposts:** 49\n  - **Release date:** July 2, 2017\n\nNote that the tool only returned partial information about the first album and potentially started listing others, but the output was cut off. The complete list of 20 albums requested was not fully provided.\n\n## 5. Taylor Swift's 'Midnights' Album\n\nI was able to retrieve some information about Taylor Swift's 'Midnights' album using the Spotify API:\n\n- **Album type:** album\n- **Total tracks:** 13\n- **Available in:** 169 markets worldwide (including US, UK, Canada, Australia, etc.)\n- **Album ID:** 151w1FgRZfnKZA9FEcg9Z3\n\nHowever, the output was truncated and did not include complete details about the tracks, release date, popularity metrics, or other detailed information you requested.\n\n## Summary\n\nUnfortunately, I was only able to retrieve partial information for your music trend analysis presentation. Several tools returned errors or incomplete data. To create a comprehensive cross-platform music trend analysis, you may need to:\n\n1. Upgrade to a higher plan for the Spotify Scraper to access top albums\n2. Use correct artist IDs to retrieve information about Einaudi and Zimmer\n3. Find an alternative source for YouTube music video data from early 2023\n4. Request complete data for SoundCloud classical albums\n5. Obtain full details about Taylor Swift's 'Midnights' album\n\nThe limited data gathered is insufficient for a thorough cross-platform analysis of music trends and artist performance across different streaming services.",

While we're at it, I'd love to see which music videos were most popular on YouTube during the first week of 2023. I'm particularly interested in classical music, so could you pull about 20 classical albums from SoundCloud?

What were people watching as 2023 kicked off? Specifically, which music videos were capturing attention on YouTube during that very first week of January? I've also been developing a deeper appreciation for classical compositions - what kind of classical collections might I find on SoundCloud if I were to browse through about 20 of them? Oh, and there's this particular album (151w1FgRZfnKZA9FEcg9Z3) on Spotify that someone recommended - I'd love to know more about what's on it before I give it a listen."

    "final_answer": "# Global Music Discovery Session Results\n\n## 1. Artists Similar to Billie Eilish\n\nThe Spotify Related Artists tool provided several artists with similar styles to Billie Eilish:\n\n- **Melanie Martinez**: Alt Z, electropop, pop (Popularity: 80/100)\n- **Halsey**: Electropop, etherpop, indie poptimism, pop (Popularity: 81/100)\n\nThe tool returned additional artists, but the output was cut off, so this is only a partial list of similar artists.\n\n## 2. Twitter-Trending Songs\n\nThe Billboard-API tool for HOT TRENDING SONGS POWERED BY TWITTER returned an error message:\n\n> \"ERROR: Please check the endpoint address and parameters.\"\n> \"The Billboard-API is updated weekly and the Billboard chart is based on Saturday.\"\n\nUnfortunately, we couldn't retrieve the current Twitter-trending songs due to this error.\n\n## 3. Global Spotify Top Tracks\n\nThe Spotify Top 200 tool provided the following global chart information:\n\n1. **\"Golden\"** by HUNTR/X, EJAE, AUDREY NUNA, REI AMI, KPop Demon Hunters Cast\n2. **\"back to friends\"** by sombr\n3. [Third track information was cut off]\n\nNote that this data appears to be from a future date (2025), which suggests there may be an issue with the data returned. Additionally, the output was truncated, so we only have information for the top 2-3 tracks rather than the full top 10.\n\n## 4. Taylor Swift Music Videos\n\nThe Genius Song Lyrics tool returned one music video related to Taylor Swift:\n\n- **\"You Need to Calm Down\"** - This video celebrates Pride Month and announced her album 'Lover'\n\nThe tool output was cut off, so this is only a partial list of Taylor Swift's music videos.\n\n## 5. Electronic Dance Music Radio Genres\n\nThe 50K Radio Stations tool returned only one electronic music genre when searching with the keyword \"electronic\":\n\n- **Electronica** (ID: 31)\n\nThis appears to be a very limited result, as there are typically many sub-genres within electronic dance music.\n\n## 6. Songs Related to 'Midnight Dreams'\n\nThe Shazam search tool found at least one song matching \"midnight dreams\":\n\n- **\"Midnight Dreams\"** by purge! & TH3 KXD\n\nThe output was cut off, so there may be additional songs that weren't displayed in the results.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've gathered some information for your global music discovery session, but several of the tool results were incomplete or contained errors. You have a starting point with artists similar to Billie Eilish, one Taylor Swift music video, a limited view of global Spotify tracks (though the data appears questionable), one electronic music radio genre, and at least one song related to 'midnight dreams'. Unfortunately, the Twitter trending songs request failed completely, and most other results were partial due to truncated outputs.",

While you're at it, I'd love to see what's trending globally on Spotify's daily Top 200 songs chart. For some visual content, could you pull up 5 music videos from Genius for artist ID 1177 from the first page of results?

I'm also curious about what songs were creating buzz on social media in early November last year. And globally, what tracks were people streaming the most? I'd love to see some visual content from that female artist who's known for her narrative songwriting and country-pop crossover - I believe she's artist #1177 on that lyrics platform. Also, I'm trying to find some radio stations that play those synthesizer-heavy beats and electronic sounds for my late-night coding sessions. Oh, and there's this song with 'midnight dreams' in the title that I heard recently - I can only remember those words but would love to find it again, just the top few matches would help."

SoundCloud Users Creating Piano Music Similar to Ludovico Einaudi\nThe SoundCloud search returned only 2 users for the search term \"Ludovico piano\":\n\n1. **Les Fous du Piano**\n   - Description: A French channel providing piano music advice and lessons\n   - Track count: 1\n   - Follower count: 0\n\n2. **Ludovica Ciano**\n   - No description available\n   - Track count: 0\n   - Playlist count: 1\n\n**Note:** The search results appear to be truncated and don't seem to include users specifically creating music similar to Ludovico Einaudi's style.\n\n## 5. Extended Version of \"Experience\" by Ludovico Einaudi\nThe Miza tool for extending the song returned an error: `{'message': \"Endpoint '/ytdlp' does not exist\"}`. Unfortunately, I couldn't create the 45-minute extended version of \"Experience\" for your meditation session.\n\n## 6. Taylor Swift's 'Folklore' Album Information\nThe Spotify tool successfully retrieved information about Taylor Swift's 'Folklore' album:\n\n- Album name: folklore\n- Release date: July 24, 2020\n- Total tracks: 16\n- Album type: album\n- Album cover: Available in multiple resolutions\n\n**Note:** While the tool returned basic album information, the track listing was not included in the output as it appears to be truncated.\n\n## Summary\nI was able to provide you with most of the requested information for your music discovery session, including Owl City's lyrics (though slightly incomplete), a Coldplay-style radio playlist, partial Billboard Independent Albums chart data, limited SoundCloud user results, and basic information about Taylor Swift's 'Folklore' album. Unfortunately, I couldn't extend \"Experience\" by Ludovico Einaudi due to a tool error, and some of the information returned was incomplete or truncated.",

I'd also like to create a radio playlist inspired by Coldplay using their Spotify URI. While you're at it, would you mind pulling up the Billboard Independent Albums chart from October 21, 2023? I'm also interested in discovering new artists - can you search for SoundCloud users related to 'Ludovico piano' and limit the results to 10? There's this YouTube piano piece (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VONMkKkdf4) that I love, but it's too long - could you trim it to just the first 45 minutes and convert it to MP3 format? Lastly, I need the details for a specific Spotify album with the ID '2fenSS68JI1h4Fo296JfGr'.",
    "hard_rewrite": "I've been diving into the music scene lately and feeling nostalgic. That Owl City song with the lyrics about seashells and saltwater has been stuck in my head - I'd love to see those exact words again. Also, I'm creating an ambiance for a dinner party inspired by that British band known for 'Yellow' and 'Viva La Vida' - what similar artists might complement that vibe? I'm curious about which independent artists were making waves last October, specifically around the third week. On a different note, I've been searching for piano compositions similar to that Italian composer known for minimalist, emotional pieces - maybe there are some interesting SoundCloud artists in that style? About ten suggestions would be perfect. I also found this beautiful YouTube piano performance that's quite lengthy, but I only have time to listen to the first 45 minutes as an MP3 for my commute. Oh, and I've heard great things about that 2020 album with the black and white forest cover art - what exactly is on that record?"

BTS Member Jungkook Information\n\nThe K-POP Idols tool successfully provided detailed information about Jungkook:\n\n- **Full Name**: Jeon Jungkook\n- **Korean Name**: \uc804\uc815\uad6d (Stage Name in Korean: \uc815\uad6d)\n- **Date of Birth**: September 1, 1997\n- **Group**: BTS\n- **Country**: South Korea\n- **Height/Weight**: 178 cm / 66 kg\n- **Birthplace**: Busan\n- **Gender**: Male\n\nNotably, the data shows no information for his position in the group, and no linked social media accounts (Instagram/Twitter) were provided in the database.\n\n## 3. YouTube Music - Bad Bunny Search Results\n\nThe YouTube Music API returned partial results for Bad Bunny:\n\n- **Top Result**: Bad Bunny (Artist)\n  - Subscriber count: 156M\n  - Artist ID: UCiY3z8HAGD6BlSNKVn2kSvQ\n\n- **Songs**:\n  1. \"NUEVAYoL\" - Duration: 3:04\n  2. \"Tit\u00ed Me Pregunt\u00f3\" - Duration: 4:04 (Explicit)\n\nThe tool response was truncated, showing only the beginning of what appears to be more search results. This limitation means we don't have the complete list of trending Latin music by Bad Bunny.\n\n## 4. Shazam Global Chart\n\nThe Shazam charts/track tool was called but returned no data. This component of your dashboard will require troubleshooting or an alternative data source for retrieving the current top 20 songs on Shazam's global chart.\n\n## 5. The Weeknd Spotify Profile\n\nThe Spotify Artist Details tool returned an HTML error page instead of artist data. The response indicates there might be access restrictions or authentication issues with the API. This component will require troubleshooting to properly retrieve The Weeknd's profile information.\n\n## 6. Kooed Radio Stations\n\nThe Kooed endpoint was called but returned no data. This component of your dashboard will require troubleshooting or an alternative data source for radio station information.\n\n## Summary\n\nYour music discovery dashboard currently has significant data gaps. Only the information about BTS member Jungkook and partial data about Bad Bunny from YouTube Music were successfully retrieved. The other four data sources (Genius, Shazam, Spotify, and Kooed) either returned errors or no data.\n\nTo create the comprehensive multi-platform music snapshot you're aiming for, you'll need to resolve these API issues or find alternative data sources. Once resolved, you could compare popularity metrics like Bad Bunny's 156M YouTube subscribers against other platforms' metrics to create the cross-platform analysis you're seeking.",

    "final_answer": "# Summer Music Festival Planning Research\n\n## 1. Top Trending Songs on Twitter (November 2021)\n\nThe Billboard-API provided the HOT TRENDING SONGS POWERED BY TWITTER chart from November 6, 2021, which shows the following top 10 trending songs for your throwback segment:\n\n1. \"Butter\" by BTS (ranked #1, up from #7 the previous week)\n2. \"Rock With You\" by SEVENTEEN (new entry at #2)\n3. \"Permission To Dance\" by BTS (down from #1)\n4. \"Money\" by Lisa (down from #2)\n5. \"Lalisa\" by Lisa (down from #3)\n6. \"Savage\" by aespa (remained at #6)\n7. \"Spaceman\" by Mew Suppasit (new entry)\n8. \"Tamed-Dashed\" by ENHYPEN (down from #5)\n9. \"My Universe\" by Coldplay x BTS (down from #4)\n10. \"Dynamite\" by BTS (up from #12)\n\nNotably, BTS appears three times in this list, showing their strong social media presence during this period.\n\n## 2. Billboard's All-Time Greatest Summer Songs\n\nUnfortunately, the Billboard_v2 tool returned an error when attempting to retrieve the Greatest of All Time Songs of the Summer chart. The specific error was a connection issue to the database (ENOTFOUND error). This information is not available for your festival planning at this time.\n\n## 3. Inspirational Music Quotes for Promotional Materials\n\nThe Radio World API returned several quotes, though most were not specifically about music. Here are a few that might be adaptable for your promotional materials:\n\n- \"I love sci-fi because it leads in the imagination, and I always say it has the most intelligent fans in the world.\" - Robert Carlyle (This could be adapted to reference music fans)\n- \"Writing and travel broaden your ass if not your mind and I like to write standing up.\" - Ernest Hemingway (Could be modified to relate to music experiences)\n\nNote that the tool returned only a partial list of quotes (the output was cut off), and most weren't specifically music-related. You may need additional sources for more relevant music quotes.\n\n## 4. Popular Songs from March 2020 (Pre-Pandemic Nostalgia)\n\nThe Billboard Hot 100 chart from March 18, 2020 shows these top songs for your pre-pandemic nostalgia segment:\n\n1. \"The Box\" by Roddy Ricch (14 weeks on chart, #1 position)\n2. \"Don't Start Now\" by Dua Lipa (19 weeks on chart)\n3. \"Life Is Good\" by Future Featuring Drake (9 weeks on chart)\n4. \"Blinding Lights\" by The Weeknd (15 weeks on chart) - Marked with an award\n5. \"Circles\" by Post Malone (28 weeks on chart, previously reached #1)\n6. \"Baby Pluto\" by Lil Uzi Vert (new entry) - Marked with an award\n7. \"Roxanne\" by Arizona Zervas (19 weeks on chart)\n8. \"Lo Mein\" by Lil Uzi Vert (new entry) - Marked with an award\n9. \"Silly Watch\" by Lil Uzi Vert (new entry) - Marked with an award\n\nNote that the output was cut off after the 9th entry, so the complete Hot 100 list is not available here.\n\n## 5. Taylor Swift's 'Lover' Album Details\n\nThe Spotify API provided partial information about Taylor Swift's 'Lover' album:\n\n- Release Date: August 23, 2019\n- Total Tracks: 18\n- Album Type: Album\n- Available in numerous markets worldwide\n\nThe album has official cover art available in three sizes. Unfortunately, the tool output was cut off before providing the full track listing, which would be important for planning a Taylor Swift tribute section.\n\n## 6. Summer Vibes Song Suggestions\n\nThe Shazam auto-complete tool provided very limited results for \"summer vibes\" with only three suggestions:\n- summer vibes\n- summer vibes music\n- collin de groot, vitaly gray & summer vibes\n\nThis is extremely limited information and doesn't provide actual song titles beyond one artist collaboration.\n\n## Summary and Recommendations\n\nBased on the available information:\n\n1. For your throwback segment, consider featuring BTS hits like \"Butter\" and \"Permission to Dance\" which were trending in November 2021.\n\n2. For the pre-pandemic nostalgia segment, \"The Box\" by Roddy Ricch, \"Don't Start Now\" by Dua Lipa, and \"Blinding Lights\" by The Weeknd would be excellent choices as they were topping the charts in March 2020.\n\n3. For the Taylor Swift tribute, we know her \"Lover\" album has 18 tracks, but you'll need additional research to get the complete track listing and identify the most popular songs from the album.\n\n4. Several tools returned incomplete information or errors, so you'll need additional research for:\n   - Classic summer anthems (the tool failed completely)\n   - More inspirational music quotes (limited relevant results)\n   - More summer vibes songs (very limited suggestions)\n   - Complete details on Taylor Swift's Lover album (truncated information)\n\nI recommend consulting additional sources to fill these gaps in your festival planning.",

    "final_answer": "# Comprehensive Analysis of Viral Music Trends Across Platforms\n\n## 1. Fastest Music Videos to Reach 1 Billion Views on YouTube\n\nThe MusicData API provided a ranking of the fastest music videos to reach 1 billion views on YouTube:\n\n1. Adele - Hello (Official Music Video) - 87.4 days\n2. Luis Fonsi - Despacito ft. Daddy Yankee - 96.5 days\n3. Ed Sheeran - Shape of You (Official Music Video) - 97.4 days\n4. J Balvin, Willy William - Mi Gente (Official Video) - 102.7 days\n5. Luis Fonsi, Demi Lovato - \u00c9chame La Culpa - 110.7 days\n\nThe tool returned the top 14 videos, showing Adele's \"Hello\" as the clear leader, reaching 1 billion views in just 87.4 days. It's worth noting that the output appears to have been truncated, as the description for the 14th entry (PSY - GANGNAM STYLE) was cut off.\n\n## 2. Information About Billie Eilish's 'Bad Guy'\n\nUnfortunately, the Shazam tool did not return information about Billie Eilish's 'Bad Guy' as requested. Instead, it returned details about \"STAY\" by The Kid LAROI & Justin Bieber. The output was also truncated. This represents a significant gap in the requested information.\n\n## 3. Most Viewed English-Language Music Videos in the Last 24 Hours\n\nThe MusicData API provided the following ranking for the most viewed English-language music videos in the last 24 hours:\n\n1. Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars - Die With A Smile - 2,735,727 views, 42,779 likes\n2. The Emptiness Machine - Linkin Park - 1,467,101 views, 46,301 likes\n3. Crazy Frog - Axel F - 1,466,272 views, 4,044 likes\n4. Sabrina Carpenter - Taste - 1,254,276 views, 16,771 likes\n5. Sabrina Carpenter - Espresso - 1,180,691 views, 10,465 likes\n\nThe tool returned the top 11 videos, though the 11th entry (In The End by Linkin Park) was cut off mid-description. It's notable that Linkin Park has two videos in the top 10, and Sabrina Carpenter also appears twice.\n\n## 4. Children's Songs from '\u00c5h Abe' Album\n\nThe Kjoller tool successfully retrieved information about one song from the '\u00c5h Abe' album:\n\n- Title: \"Jeg er en papeg\u00f8je fra Amerika\"\n- Text: Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner \u2013 p\u00e5 dansk ved Halfdan Rasmussen\n- Melody: Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner\n- Album: \u00c5h Abe!\n- Release Year: 1993 - 1999\n\nThe tool provided complete lyrics for this Danish children's song. However, the output was truncated, and it's unclear if there were more songs from this album in the complete response. This represents only a partial fulfillment of the request for children's songs from this album.\n\n## 5. Shazam Detections for 'Bad Guy'\n\nThe Shazam tool did not provide information about Billie Eilish's 'Bad Guy' as requested. Instead, it returned detection count information for song ID 552221348 (which appears to be \"STAY\" by The Kid LAROI & Justin Bieber based on the previous tool call), showing 16,705,267 total Shazam detections. This represents a significant gap in the requested information.\n\n## 6. Most Popular Music Videos from the 21st Week of 2019\n\nThe MusicData API provided the following ranking for the most viewed music videos during the 21st week of 2019:\n\n1. Daddy Yankee & Snow - Con Calma - 42,637,249 views (+2,761,921)\n2. ROSAL\u00cdA, J Balvin - Con Altura - 35,933,384 views (+1,840,529)\n3. Pedro Cap\u00f3, Farruko - Calma (Remix) - 34,557,357 views (+2,625,729)\n4. Te Robar\u00e9 - Nicky Jam x Ozuna - 30,369,080 views (-5,070,691)\n5. Soltera Remix - Lunay X Daddy Yankee X Bad Bunny - 29,584,502 views (-11,109,429)\n\nThe tool returned 9 entries, with the 9th entry (Vaaste Song) being cut off. Latin music dominated the charts during this week, with 7 of the top 8 videos being Spanish-language content.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis analysis provides valuable insights into viral music trends across platforms, though with significant gaps. The data shows that Latin music has strong global appeal, with artists like Daddy Yankee appearing multiple times across different metrics. The fastest videos to reach 1 billion views demonstrate the accelerating pace of music video consumption over time. Unfortunately, the specific information requested about Billie Eilish's 'Bad Guy' was not provided by the tools, representing a major limitation in this analysis.",

Billboard's Top 10 Greatest Artists of All Time\n\nThe Billboard_v2 tool returned an error when attempting to retrieve this information:\n```\nError: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND billboard.cctuex9y9o7b.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com\n```\nUnfortunately, I cannot provide Billboard's official top 10 greatest artists of all time due to this technical issue with the database connection.\n\n## 2. Most Viewed YouTube Music Videos from 2017\n\nThe MusicData API successfully retrieved the most viewed YouTube videos published in 2017. Here are the top 10:\n\n1. Luis Fonsi - Despacito ft. Daddy Yankee (8,562,662,836 views)\n2. Ed Sheeran - Shape of You (6,346,098,427 views)\n3. Ed Sheeran - Perfect (3,819,062,733 views)\n4. J Balvin, Willy William - Mi Gente (3,405,488,006 views)\n5. Dua Lipa - New Rules (3,083,848,302 views)\n6. Imagine Dragons - Believer (2,715,849,812 views)\n7. Natti Natasha \u274c Ozuna - Criminal (2,640,217,806 views)\n8. Becky G, Bad Bunny - Mayores (2,468,324,503 views)\n9. Luis Fonsi, Demi Lovato - \u00c9chame La Culpa (2,378,756,653 views)\n10. Bruno Mars - That's What I Like (2,316,943,351 views)\n\nNote: The tool returned additional entries beyond the top 10, but the output was truncated in the results.\n\n## 3. Most Streamed Spotify Songs from 2018\n\nThe MusicData API successfully retrieved the most streamed songs on Spotify from 2018:\n\n1. Lewis Capaldi - Someone You Loved (3,596,944,599 streams)\n2. Post Malone - Sunflower (3,525,257,432 streams)\n3. Post Malone - rockstar (3,032,616,163 streams)\n4. Billie Eilish - lovely (2,985,889,478 streams)\n5.

(2,268,662,211 streams)\n\nNote: The tool returned additional entries beyond the top 10, but the output was truncated in the results.\n\n## 4. Information About The Beatles\n\nThe Spotify Web API provided the following information about The Beatles:\n\n- **Name**: The Beatles\n- **Spotify ID**: 3WrFJ7ztbogyGnTHbHJFl2\n- **Followers**: 30,369,988\n- **Genres**: Classic Rock, Psychedelic Rock\n- **Popularity**: 87 (out of 100)\n- **Spotify URL**: https://open.spotify.com/artist/3WrFJ7ztbogyGnTHbHJFl2\n\n## 5. Children's Songs Composed by Carl Orff\n\nThe kjoller tool was used to search for songs composed by Orff, but returned no results:\n```\n{'status': 'OK', 'data': []}\n```\nThis suggests either the tool doesn't have data on Carl Orff's compositions or there might be limitations in how the search was performed.\n\n## 6. Popular Indonesian Songs from May 2022\n\nThe Billboard-API tool returned the following message when attempting to retrieve Indonesian songs from May 2022:\n```\n{'notice': 'This endpoint is available on the Ultra plan and above. If you want to access this endpoint, please upgrade your plan.'}\n```\nUnfortunately, I cannot provide information about popular Indonesian songs from May 2022 due to access restrictions with the API.\n\n## 7. Billie Eilish's Most Recognized Songs\n\nThe Shazam search tool returned information about Billie Eilish's music, but the results were limited and partially truncated. The only complete result shows:\n\n- **Title**: BIRDS OF A FEATHER\n- **Artist**: Billie Eilish\n- **Shazam Key**: 697038460\n\nNote: The search was limited to 5 results, but even these were truncated in the output, providing incomplete information about Billie Eilish's most recognized songs.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've gathered information for several sections of your music presentation, though with some limitations. Complete data was obtained for YouTube's most viewed videos from 2017, Spotify's most streamed songs from 2018, and basic information about The Beatles. However, I couldn't retrieve Billboard's greatest artists of all time due to a technical error, found no children's songs by Carl Orff in the database, couldn't access Indonesian songs data due to plan restrictions, and received only partial information about Billie Eilish's songs. You may need to supplement these gaps with additional research from other sources for your comprehensive presentation.",

I'm also interested in classical compositions by Orff - what pieces might I discover? I was wondering what Indonesian listeners were enjoying in early May 2022, particularly around the 7th. And finally, I've been getting into that young artist with the unique whispery voice - could you find some of her popular tracks on Shazam?

These skills were evident on her earliest hits, especially the neo-tribute \u201cTim McGraw,\u201d but her second album, 2008\u2032s Fearless, showcased a songwriter discovering who she was and, in the process, finding a mass audience.

Artist Spotlight: Halsey\n\nFor the artist spotlight, we retrieved a random Halsey song: \"Bells in Santa Fe\". Here's an excerpt from the lyrics:\n\n> \"Don't call me by my name  \n> All of this is temporary  \n> Watch as I slip away for your sake  \n> All of this is temporary\"  \n\nThe song features haunting lyrics about impermanence and departure, with repeated phrases like \"It's not a happy ending\" and \"Don't wait for me.\"\n\n## 3. Halsey's 'Manic' Album Information\n\nHalsey's album \"Manic\" was released on January 17, 2020. The album contains 15 songs, though the tool only returned the IDs of these songs rather than their titles. This critically acclaimed album represents a significant work in Halsey's discography from the year of our analysis.\n\n## 4. Top YouTube Artists of 2019 (Historical Comparison)\n\nThe top YouTube artists of 2019 were:\n\n1. BTS (3,977,298,636 views)\n2. Daddy Yankee (3,859,704,066 views)\n3.

Taylor Swift ranked #20 with 2,096,606,782 views.*\n\n## 5. Billie Eilish's 'bad guy' Music Video\n\nThe tool returned some metadata about Billie Eilish's \"bad guy\" music video (ID: DyDfgMOUjCI), including:\n\n- Platform: YouTube Music\n- Category: Music\n- Description: \"Listen to 'bad guy' from the debut album 'WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?', out now: http://smarturl.it/BILLIEALBUM Listen to 'Happier Than Ever'...\"\n- The video is available in nearly all countries worldwide\n- It is marked as family-safe content\n\n*Note: The tool returned partial information about the video, with the full description and some metadata being truncated.*\n\n## 6. Taylor Swift Cross-Platform Information\n\nUsing Taylor Swift's Spotify URL, we retrieved the following cross-platform links:\n\n- Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02\n- Apple Music: https://music.apple.com/us/artist/taylor-swift/159260351?app=music\n- YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqECaJ8Gagnn7YCbPEzWH6g\n- Deezer: https://deezer.com/artist/12246\n- Amazon Music: https://music.amazon.com/artists/B00157GJ20\n\nThe tool also returned a partial artist description highlighting Taylor Swift's evolution from country to mainstream pop and her success with albums like Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989, and Reputation.\n\n## 7. Kooed Radio Station Website Structure\n\nThe tool call to evaluate Kooed's radio station website structure returned no information. This suggests either the endpoint is not functioning correctly, requires additional parameters, or the website may not be accessible through this method. Further investigation would be needed to evaluate this potential promotional partner.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis global music analysis for September 2020 reveals a diverse international music landscape with Latin artists like Maluma topping the global charts, while K-pop acts BTS and BLACKPINK showed strong performance both in September 2020 and throughout 2019 on YouTube. Halsey's \"Manic\" album from January 2020 represents an important release from earlier in the year. Historical data shows that global music consumption on YouTube in 2019 was dominated by BTS, with several Latin artists and pop stars like Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish also performing strongly. Taylor Swift maintains a strong presence across all major streaming platforms. Unfortunately, we couldn't evaluate Kooed's radio station website as a promotional partner due to lack of data from the tool call.",

Billboard Japan Hot 100 Chart (Last Week)\n\nThe Billboard-API tool provided the top 10 songs from the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart dated June 3, 2023:\n\n1. \"Idol\" by YOASOBI (7 weeks at #1)\n2. \"FANFARE\" by INI (up from #10)\n3. \"Utsukushii Hire\" by Spitz (down from #2)\n4. \"Kaiju No Hanauta\" by VAUNDY (up from #5)\n5. \"Boku Ha Konya Deteyuku\" by Nanabun No Nijyuuni (new entry)\n6. \"Tattoo\" by Official HIGE DANdism (up from #7)\n7. \"Kizuna No Kiseki\" by MAN WITH A MISSION x milet (up from #8)\n8. \"Subtitle\" by Official HIGE DANdism (up from #9)\n\n**Note: The tool output was truncated and only provided 8 of the top 10 songs.**\n\n## 2. UK Rock Music Radio Stations\n\nThe Radio World tool was queried for stations in the UK (country_id: 235), but returned no results. The country ID appears to have been incorrect, as the response indicated \"Jersey\" as the country, not the United Kingdom. The tool returned 0 radio stations with the message: \"total_radios: 0\".\n\n## 3. Upcoming US Concerts\n\nThe Spotify Concerts tool returned partial information about an upcoming concert:\n\n- Event: Concert at RFK Stadium in Washington\n- Date: July 15, 2023, 8:00 PM\n- Featured Artists: Lil Uzi Vert, Jazmine Sullivan, and multiple other artists\n\n**Note: The tool output was truncated and only provided information about one concert event, not a full month of concerts across the US as requested.**\n\n## 4. Spotify User Playlists\n\nThe Spotify _v2 tool for retrieving user playlists returned an error:\n\"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider\"\n\nUnfortunately, we couldn't retrieve the playlists for user 'musicexplorer'.\n\n## 5. Artists Similar to Coldplay\n\nThe Spotify _v2 tool for finding related artists also returned an error:\n\"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider\"\n\nWe were unable to retrieve artists similar to Coldplay.\n\n## 6. YouTube Music Watch Playlist\n\nThe YouTube Music API successfully created a watch playlist starting with Billie Eilish's \"Bad Guy\". The playlist includes:\n\n1. \"bad guy\" by Billie Eilish (3:26)\n2. \"BIRDS OF A FEATHER\" by Billie Eilish (3:51)\n3. A song by ROS\u00c9 & Bruno Mars (2:54)\n\n**Note: The tool output was truncated and only showed the first 3 songs in the generated playlist.**\n\n## 7. Music Genres on Radio Stations Worldwide\n\nThe 50K Radio Stations tool was queried for music genres, but returned very limited information:\n- Only one genre category was returned: \"Music\" (ID: 62)\n\n**Note: This result is extremely limited and doesn't provide the diverse range of music genres that would be expected.**\n\n## Summary\n\nYour music discovery day plan has some useful elements but is incomplete due to several tool limitations and errors. You have access to recent Billboard Japan charts and a YouTube Music playlist starting with Billie Eilish, but information about UK rock radio stations, comprehensive US concert listings, Spotify user playlists, Coldplay-similar artists, and worldwide radio genres was either missing, limited, or unavailable due to API errors. To create a truly comprehensive music discovery day, you may need to seek additional sources of information.",

    "final_answer": "# Global Music Trends Analysis\n\n## 1. Twitter Trending Songs\nThe Billboard-API provided data on Hot Trending Songs powered by Twitter, but it's important to note that this data is from November 6, 2021, which is not current.

US chart data from June 10, 2023 shows:\n\n1. \"Idol\" by YOASOBI\n2. \"Cupid\" by Fifty Fifty\n3. \"La Bebe\" by Yng Lvcas x Peso Pluma\n4. \"Flowers\" by Miley Cyrus\n5. \"Ella Baila Sola\" by Eslabon Armado X Peso Pluma\n6. \"Where She Goes\" by Bad Bunny\n\nNote that this data appears to be truncated, as we only received the top 6 entries. The chart shows strong representation from Latin artists (Peso Pluma appears twice) and Japanese artists (YOASOBI at #1).\n\n## 4. YouTube's Trending Music in Germany\nThe YouTube Music API provided trending artists in Germany, though the data appears to be truncated. The top 5 trending artists were:\n\n1. AYLIVA (782K subscribers)\n2. Linkin Park (23.8M subscribers)\n3. Apache 207 (1.51M subscribers, trending up)\n4. Bonez MC (246K subscribers)\n5. [Incomplete data for #5]\n\nThis shows a mix of local German artists (AYLIVA, Apache 207, Bonez MC) alongside international acts like Linkin Park.\n\n## 5. Historical Comparison: YouTube Music Videos (Week 21, 2019)\nThe most viewed YouTube music videos from the 21st week of 2019 were:\n\n1. \"Con Calma\" by Daddy Yankee & Snow (42.6M views, up 3 positions)\n2. \"Con Altura\" by ROSAL\u00cdA, J Balvin ft.

Darell (28.6M views, up 3 positions)\n8. \"Bekhayali\" from Kabir Singh (28.3M views, new entry)\n\nThis historical data shows a strong dominance of Latin music in 2019, with 7 of the top 8 videos being Spanish-language tracks.\n\n## 6. Top YouTube Featured Artists (2022)\nThe top 10 YouTube artists who appeared as featured artists in 2022 were:\n\n1. Bad Bunny (10.04B views)\n2. Blackpink (4.72B views)\n3. BTS (4.71B views)\n4. Karol G (4.16B views)\n5. Anuel AA (3.62B views)\n6. Ozuna (3.58B views)\n7. Mar\u00edlia Mendon\u00e7a (3.58B views)\n8. J Balvin (3.58B views)\n9. Daddy Yankee (3.51B views)\n10. Rauw Alejandro (3.19B views)\n\nLatin artists dominated this list, with Bad Bunny having more than double the views of the second-place artist. K-pop acts (Blackpink, BTS) also showed strong performance.\n\n## 7. Children's Songs by Bellman\nThe search for children's songs by composer 'bellman' returned only one result:\n- \"Bj\u00f8rnen sover\" (The Bear is Sleeping), a classic children's song with melody by C.M. Bellman\n\n## Summary of Global Music Trends\n\nBased on the data collected, several key trends emerge across platforms, regions, and time periods:\n\n1. **Regional Differences**: Latin music dominates globally (especially on YouTube), while K-pop acts like BTS and Blackpink maintain strong social media presence and viewership. In Germany, local artists feature prominently alongside international acts.\n\n2. **Platform Variations**: Twitter trending songs (from 2021) showed strong K-pop dominance, while YouTube's current English-language trending videos feature a mix of new releases and classics.\n\n3. **Temporal Changes**: Comparing 2019 to current trends shows the continued strength of Latin music, though with new artists emerging. The staying power of certain songs (like \"See You Again\" still trending years after release) demonstrates how streaming platforms extend music longevity.\n\n4. **Demographic Appeal**: Children's music represents a specialized niche with classic compositions like Bellman's \"Bj\u00f8rnen sover\" remaining relevant.\n\n5. **Cross-Cultural Collaboration**: Featured artist data shows the importance of collaborations in building global reach, with artists like Bad Bunny leveraging features to achieve massive viewership.\n\nIt's worth noting that some of the data provided was limited or outdated (Twitter data from 2021, partial Billboard chart), which affects the comprehensiveness of this analysis.",

Current Trending Artists in Germany on YouTube Music\nThe YouTube Music API provided the top trending artists in Germany. Here are the top 5 artists:\n\n1. AYLIVA (782K subscribers)\n2. Linkin Park (23.8M subscribers)\n3. Apache 207 (1.51M subscribers, trending up)\n4. Bonez MC (246K subscribers)\n5. [Incomplete data - the API response was cut off]\n\n**Limitation**: The tool only returned partial data for the top 5 artists, with the fifth artist's information being cut off mid-response.\n\n## 2. Billboard Global Chart Excluding the US\nThe Billboard Global Excl. US chart from November 1, 2023 shows:\n\n1. \"Si No Estas\" by Inigo Quintero\n2. \"Seven\" by Jung Kook featuring Latto\n3. \"Greedy\" by Tate McRae\n4. \"Cruel Summer\" by Taylor Swift\n5. \"Paint The Town Red\" by Doja Cat\n6. \"Perro Negro\" by Bad Bunny & Feid\n\n**Limitation**: The response was truncated and only provided the top 6 entries from the chart.\n\n## 3. Billboard's Greatest Artists of All Time\nUnfortunately, the tool returned an error when attempting to retrieve Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists chart. The specific error was: \"getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND billboard.cctuex9y9o7b.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com\", indicating a connection issue to Billboard's database.\n\n## 4. Popular Worldwide Radio Stations\nThe Radio World tool provided a sample of worldwide radio stations. Some notable stations include:\n\n- R\u00e1dio 104 FM Bezerros (Brazil)\n- Radio Atl\u00e1ntida (Bolivia)\n- R\u00e1di\u00f3 1 (Hungary)\n- GotRadio - Piano Perfect (USA)\n- Gartenwelt Frey (Germany)\n\n**Limitation**: The tool only returned a limited selection of 15 radio stations from the database of over 79,000 stations.\n\n## 5. Upcoming Concerts in the US\nThe Spotify Concerts tool returned information about events in the US, including:\n\n- A concert at RFK Stadium in Washington featuring multiple artists including Lil Uzi Vert and Jazmine Sullivan\n\n**Limitation**: The response was incomplete, showing only one concert event, and the date shown (July 15, 2023) appears to be from a past event rather than upcoming concerts.\n\n## 6. Billboard Global 200 Chart\nThe Billboard Global 200 chart from November 1, 2023 shows:\n\n1. \"Cruel Summer\" by Taylor Swift (peak position: 1, weeks on chart: 32)\n2. \"Paint The Town Red\" by Doja Cat (peak position: 1, weeks on chart: 12)\n3. \"Greedy\" by Tate McRae (peak position: 3, weeks on chart: 6)\n4. \"Monaco\" by Bad Bunny (peak position: 1, weeks on chart: 2)\n5. \"Si No Estas\" by Inigo Quintero (peak position: 5, weeks on chart: 4)\n6. \"Seven\" by Jung Kook featuring Latto (peak position: 1, weeks on chart: 15)\n\n**Limitation**: The response was truncated and only provided the top 6 entries from the chart.\n\n## 7. Songs by Mozart\nThe query for songs by the composer Mozart returned an empty dataset. The tool responded with status \"OK\" but the data array was empty, suggesting either the database doesn't contain Mozart compositions or there was an issue with the search parameters.\n\n## 8. SoundCloud Electronic Music Producers\nThe SoundCloud search for \"electronic producer\" returned:\n\n- Total count: 188 users found\n- First result: Ronald Christoph (Berlin-based musician, producer, and performer with a career spanning three decades)\n\n**Limitation**: The tool only returned detailed information about the first user out of 188 total results, with the response being cut off before showing the remaining 9 requested profiles.\n\n## Summary\nThe data collection process yielded mixed results. While we obtained valuable information about current music trends in Germany, global charts, and some radio stations, several limitations were encountered: the Billboard Greatest Artists data was unavailable due to an error, the Mozart composition search returned no results, and many responses were incomplete or truncated. For a comprehensive global music analysis project, you would need to make additional queries or use alternative data sources to fill these gaps.",

And speaking of experiences, who's performing live in the US these days? I've been in a classical mood lately and particularly drawn to a certain 18th-century Austrian composer's work.

I'm also interested in learning about the K-pop idol Jungkook. While we're on the topic of international music, I'd love to see which Vietnamese artists have the most viewed music videos on YouTube. For historical context, can you share Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, just the top 10? I'd also like to check out today's top 10 songs across all genres according to Genius. Oh, and I'm curious about who the most popular YouTube artists were in 2022, including featured artists. I want to create a Spotify radio playlist inspired by Taylor Swift (spotify:artist:06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02). Lastly, my niece loves children's songs, so I'm looking for some by the author Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner.",

Also, there's this BTS member whose solo career I've been meaning to learn more about - the youngest one who sings 'Seven'. I'm also fascinated by music videos from Southeast Asian countries, particularly from the country known for pho and Hanoi. For a music history project, I need to know which artists Billboard considers the most legendary of all time. What songs are people listening to right now across all genres? I'm also researching which artists dominated YouTube views in the year before last, including collaborations. For my workout playlist, I need something that captures the vibe of that famous female artist who's rerecording all her albums and dating a football player. Finally, I'm looking for children's songs for my niece by that Norwegian author who wrote about Klatremus and the animals in Hakkebakkeskogen."

I'm also curious about what songs were trending on Twitter on November 6th, 2021 - specifically the top 10 from that day. As part of my global music exploration, I'd love to discover 5 random radio stations from around the world, and separately find 5 Japanese radio stations for a section on regional broadcasting. I'm including a section on individual artists too - could you pull a random song excerpt from Halsey along with details about the album it's from? For the contemporary music section, I need you to search for 5 electronic dance music tracks currently popular on Shazam, locate some jazz music available on streaming platforms, and identify who the top YouTube artists were in 2022.",

I wonder who Billboard considers the most influential musicians of all time - particularly the cream of the crop. Speaking of trends, what songs were capturing everyone's attention on Twitter during that first week of November 2021? I remember it was quite an interesting mix. I'm also in the mood to discover some fresh sounds - wouldn't it be fascinating to tune into a handful of random radio broadcasts from different corners of the world? And since I've been learning about Japanese culture, finding some authentic radio stations from Japan would be perfect. On another note, I've been meaning to explore more of Halsey's work - I'd love to get a taste of her lyrics and learn which album they're from. For my workout playlist, I need some new electronic dance tracks that are popular on Shazam. When I'm winding down, some jazz recommendations from streaming platforms would be ideal. And finally, I'm curious about which artists dominated YouTube last year - 2022 had some surprising musical breakouts, didn't it?"

He thus developed two distinct sides to his musical personality: one of these led him to embrace serialism and the experimental work of the improvisation group ; the other gained him a leading role, principally as an arranger, in all types of mass-media popular music, including songs for radio, radio and television plays, and the first successful television variety shows.\\r\\nAfter many minor cinematic collaborations, Morricone achieved wider recognition with Sergio Leone's series of four Westerns.

    "final_answer": "# Music-Themed International Trip Information\n\n## Halsey Songs for Your Travels\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool provided excerpts from several of Halsey's songs that you might want to listen to during your travels. The results included:\n\n- \"Is There Somewhere\" - featuring lyrics about travel themes like hotel rooms and emotional connections\n- \"Trouble (stripped)\" - a more emotional track with intimate lyrics\n- \"Empty Gold\" - only the beginning lyrics were provided\n\nNote: The tool only returned partial results, showing just the first few songs from Halsey's catalog and incomplete lyrics for each song.\n\n## Current Billboard Artist 100 Chart\nAccording to the Billboard Artist 100 chart from June 15, 2023, the top 10 most popular artists were:\n\n1. Stray Kids\n2. Taylor Swift\n3. Morgan Wallen\n4. Jelly Roll\n5. ENHYPEN\n6. Luke Combs\n7. Foo Fighters\n8. SZA\n9. Ed Sheeran\n10. Drake\n\nNote: The tool returned incomplete information about these artists, cutting off after the 10th entry, and the data is from June 2023, not current.\n\n## Indonesia Radio Stations\nThe 50K Radio Stations tool confirmed that Indonesia is available in the system as a country with radio stations (ID: 82). However, when attempting to retrieve specific music channels from Indonesia, the tool returned no results. This could be due to incorrect parameters used in the search or limitations in the database.\n\n## Billboard Greatest Songs of All Time\nUnfortunately, the Billboard Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs tool encountered an error (SequelizeHostNotFoundError) and couldn't retrieve any information about the greatest songs of all time according to Billboard.\n\n## Spotify User 'cruilla'\nThe Spotify tools provided the following information about the user 'cruilla':\n\n- Display name: cruilla\n- Profile URL: https://open.spotify.com/user/cruilla\n- Followers: 3\n- Public playlists: 0 (The tool returned an empty list, indicating this user has no public playlists)\n\n## Taylor Swift Information\nThe MusiclinkssApi tool was used with a Spotify URL, but the URL provided was actually for Ennio Morricone (not Taylor Swift). The tool returned cross-platform links for Ennio Morricone on various music services including:\n\n- Qobuz, Soundcloud, Napster, Audius, Apple Music, Deezer, Bandcamp, Tidal, Spotify, Amazon, Audiomack, and YouTube\n\nThe tool also returned a partial biography of Ennio Morricone, an Italian composer who passed away in 2020.\n\nTo get information about Taylor Swift, you would need to use her correct Spotify URL instead.\n\n## Summary\nFor your music-themed international trip, you have some Halsey songs to consider and information about currently popular artists from mid-2023. While Indonesia is confirmed as a country with radio stations in the database, no specific stations were returned. The Spotify user 'cruilla' exists but has no public playlists. Unfortunately, the Billboard Greatest Songs tool encountered an error, and the search for Taylor Swift information was unsuccessful due to using Ennio Morricone's URL instead. To complete your trip planning, you may need to conduct additional searches with corrected parameters.",

For broader context, I want to see the top 20 songs from the Billboard Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs chart. Finally, I want to explore a Spotify user named 'cruilla' - both their profile details and public playlists - and look up detailed information about Ennio Morricone using his Spotify artist URL: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1nIUhcKHnK6iyumRyoV68C.",

Since I'm interested in her global reach, I'd love to know which Indonesian radio stations might feature her music - first by gathering some basic information about Indonesia and then checking what music channels operate there. For some industry context, could you show me the top 20 songs from Billboard's Greatest of All Time Hot 100 list? Lastly, I want to check out this Spotify user called 'cruilla' - both their profile information and what playlists they've made public - and I'd appreciate detailed artist information about Halsey using her Spotify URL: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1nIUhcKHnK6iyumRyoV68C.",

On a different note, I'm planning a trip to Bali and wondering what local radio stations might play similar alternative pop music there. Speaking of influential music, I've been trying to find a definitive list of the most impactful songs of all time - maybe the top 20 or so? Lastly, I stumbled across this Spotify profile 'cruilla' that someone recommended, and I'm curious about who they are and what they curate. Oh, and that artist I mentioned earlier - I have their Spotify link saved: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1nIUhcKHnK6iyumRyoV68C - and would love to know more about their presence across different music platforms."

    "final_answer": "# Comprehensive Music Discovery Dashboard Data\n\n## 1. Top Trending English Music Videos on YouTube (Last 24 Hours)\n\nThe MusicData API successfully retrieved the top trending English music videos on YouTube in the last 24 hours:\n\n1. Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars - Die With A Smile (2,735,727 views)\n2. The Emptiness Machine - Linkin Park (1,467,101 views)\n3. Crazy Frog - Axel F (1,466,272 views)\n4. Sabrina Carpenter - Taste (1,254,276 views)\n5. Sabrina Carpenter - Espresso (1,180,691 views)\n6. The Weeknd - Save Your Tears (1,131,318 views)\n7. Wiz Khalifa - See You Again ft. Charlie Puth (1,079,561 views)\n8. Numb - Linkin Park (1,051,090 views)\n9. Megan Thee Stallion - Neva Play (feat. RM) (956,931 views)\n10. *NSYNC - Bye Bye Bye (948,483 views)\n\n*Note: The tool output appears to be truncated after the 11th entry (In The End - Linkin Park), so there may be additional trending videos not shown.*\n\n## 2. Information About K-pop Boy Group BTS\n\nThe K-POP boy-groups tool provided the following information about BTS:\n\n- **Group Name**: BTS (Bangtan Boys)\n- **Korean Name**: \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8\n- **Debut Date**: June 13, 2013\n- **Company**: Big Hit\n- **Members**: 7 (Original members: 7)\n- **Fanclub Name**: ARMY\n- **Active Status**: Yes\n- **Profile Link**: https://dbkpop.com/group/bts/\n\n## 3. Halsey Songs with Lyric Snippets\n\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool returned some of Halsey's songs with lyric excerpts:\n\n1. **Is There Somewhere**\n   - \"You were dancing in your tube socks in our hotel room\"\n   - \"I just wanna feel your lips against my skin\"\n   - \"I'm sorry but I fell in love tonight\"\n\n2. **Trouble (stripped)**\n   - \"Would you bleed for me? Lick it off my lips like you needed me?\"\n   - \"Let's cause a little trouble\"\n   - \"I've got my mind made up this time\"\n\n3. **Empty Gold**\n   - \"I, I must confess How hard I tried to breathe, through the trees of loneliness\"\n   - \"You, you must confess How hard you need to see, through the heart beating out my chest\"\n\n*Note: The tool output appears to be truncated, so this is only a partial list of Halsey's songs and lyrics.*\n\n## 4. Taylor Swift's Latest Albums on Spotify\n\nThe Spotify Search tool returned the following Taylor Swift albums (limited to 5 results):\n\n1. **Taylor Swift** (2006)\n2. **Lover** (2019)\n3. **reputation**\n\n*Note: The tool output was truncated after the third album, so this is an incomplete list of Taylor Swift's albums. Additionally, the results don't appear to be sorted by release date, so these may not represent her latest albums.*\n\n## 5. Current Billboard Catalog Albums Chart\n\nThe Billboard API returned the Catalog Albums chart for the week of October 8, 2022 (not current):\n\n1. **Dirt** - Alice In Chains\n2. **Starboy** - The Weeknd\n3. **Ctrl** - SZA\n4. **Greatest Hits** - Queen\n5. **Curtain Call: The Hits** - Eminem\n6. **good kid, m.A.A.d city** - Kendrick Lamar\n7. **Rumours** - Fleetwood Mac\n8. **YHLQMDLG** - Bad Bunny\n\n*Note: The tool output was truncated after the 8th entry, and the data is from October 2022, not current.*\n\n## 6. Specific Album from Spotify (Adele's '30')\n\nThe Spotify Web tool returned information for an album, but it was not Adele's '30' as requested. Instead, it returned information for an album called \"Kan\" by UZI released on March 19, 2021. The tool output includes track information but appears to be truncated.\n\n*Note: The requested album (Adele's '30') was not retrieved. The tool returned a different album entirely.*\n\n## 7. Children's Song with Lyrics for 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star'\n\nThe kjoller tool returned an empty data array with status \"OK\", meaning no lyrics were found for \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\".\n\n*Note: The tool failed to retrieve the requested lyrics.*\n\n## 8. YouTube Music Watch Playlist for Ed Sheeran's 'Perfect'\n\nThe YouTube Music API returned a watch playlist, but it appears to be for a different video (ID: 1A7Qw88As64) than Ed Sheeran's \"Perfect\". The returned playlist contains:\n\n1. \"Aber\" by Eko Fresh (5:32)\n2. A track by Kool Savas & Nessi from the album \"KKS\" (3:04)\n\n*Note: The tool did not return the requested playlist for Ed Sheeran's \"Perfect\". The output was also truncated after the second track.*\n\n## 9. Continuous Radio Stream for Background Music\n\nThe Emisora Radio Dosis tool returned binary data, which appears to be a stream of the radio station. This indicates that the radio stream is available, but the binary data cannot be directly displayed in the dashboard.\n\n*Note: The tool returned binary stream data that would need to be properly handled by your dashboard to play the audio stream.*",

Would love to learn more about them. While exploring artists, I've been meaning to discover more of that American singer-songwriter who did 'Without Me' - what else has she created? And speaking of popular artists, which collections from that female artist who re-records her albums have resonated most with listeners on Spotify? I'm also interested in which older albums are finding new life on the charts these days. There's this foreign album I heard about with ID '3IBcauSj5M2A6lTeffJzdv' - what can you tell me about it? My niece keeps singing that classic children's lullaby about the diamond in the sky, but I can't remember all the words. Also, I found this interesting video with ID '1A7Qw88As64' and wonder what else might play after it. Finally, I could use some background music while I work - is there a continuous stream from that Dosis station available?"

Fastest Music Videos to Reach 1 Billion Views on YouTube\nThe MusicData API provided a ranking of videos that reached 1 billion views the fastest:\n\n1. Adele - Hello (87.4 days)\n2. Luis Fonsi - Despacito ft. Daddy Yankee (96.5 days)\n3. Ed Sheeran - Shape of You (97.4 days)\n4. J Balvin, Willy William - Mi Gente (102.7 days)\n5.

Cardi B (129.0 days)\n10. Justin Bieber - Sorry (136.2 days)\n\n*Note: The tool output appears to be truncated after the 14th entry.*\n\n## 2. Taylor Swift Personalized Radio Playlist\nThe Spotify tool successfully generated a personalized radio playlist based on Taylor Swift:\n- Playlist URI: spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E4AfEUiirXPyP\n\nThis playlist can be accessed through Spotify using the provided URI.\n\n## 3. Random Halsey Lyrics for Promotional Materials\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool provided lyrics from \"Bells in Santa Fe\":\n\nHighlights include:\n- \"Don't call me by my name / All of this is temporary / Watch as I slip away for your sake / All of this is temporary\"\n- \"Well, maybe I could hold you in the dark / You won't even notice me depart\"\n- \"So don't wait for me, don't wait for me, wait-ah / It's not a happy ending\"\n\n## 4. Music Videos from Genius\nThe Genius - Song Lyrics: Videos tool returned an error indicating missing required parameters. The tool requires an artist_id parameter which was not provided. Additional information about music videos could not be retrieved.\n\n## 5. Song Suggestions for \"Summer Nights\"\nThe Shazam auto-complete tool provided limited suggestions related to \"summer nights\":\n- summer nights\n- summer nights mid july\n- summer nights rascal flatts\n\nNote that these are only search term suggestions, not actual song recommendations.\n\n## 6. Radio Stations in Miami\nThe 50K Radio Stations tool returned no results for Miami in the United States (country_id: 234). The search returned zero stations, which may indicate either no stations are available in the database for Miami or there might be an issue with the search parameters.\n\n## 7. Ed Sheeran's Albums\nThe MusiclinkssApi provided detailed information about Ed Sheeran's albums:\n\n1. +-=\u00f7\u00d7 (Tour Collection: Live) - Release date: 2024-12-27\n2. +-=\u00f7\u00d7 (Tour Collection) - Release date: 2024-09-27\n3. x (10th Anniversary Edition) - Release date: 2024-06-21\n4. Autumn Variations (Fan Living Room Sessions) - Release date: 2023-10-02\n5. Autumn Variations - Release date: 2023-09-29\n6. - (Deluxe) - Release date: 2023-05-05\n7. = (Tour Edition) - Release date: 2022-05-27\n8. = - Release date: 2021-10-25\n\n*Note: The output appears to be truncated after the 8th album.*\n\n## 8. Billie Eilish's \"Bad Guy\" Information\nThe YouTube Music API returned some metadata about the song, but the output is heavily truncated. The available information shows:\n- The song is categorized as \"Music\"\n- Description begins with: \"Listen to \"bad guy\" from the debut album \"WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?\"...\"\n- The content is marked as family safe\n- The song is available in numerous countries worldwide\n\nHowever, detailed information about the song itself is missing from the truncated output.\n\n## 9. Cities with Radio Stations in France\nThe 50K Radio Stations tool returned cities with radio stations, but the results appear to be for Jamaica (country_id: 75) rather than France. The cities listed are:\n1. Negril\n2. Ocho Rios\n3. Oracabessa\n\nThis indicates that the wrong country code was used in the query (75 instead of the code for France).\n\n## Summary\nI've gathered several resources for your music festival planning, including the fastest videos to reach 1 billion views, a Taylor Swift radio playlist, Halsey lyrics, and Ed Sheeran's album information. However, there were some limitations: the Genius tool required additional parameters, the summer nights suggestions were minimal, no Miami radio stations were found, the Billie Eilish information was incomplete, and the French radio station search returned Jamaican cities instead. You may need to refine some of these searches for more complete information.",

Speaking of artists, I randomly remembered Halsey but can't recall specific lyrics - maybe a snippet would jog my memory? I was also browsing through some music videos and wondering how many I could see on a single page. For my upcoming vacation, I'm looking for songs that capture those warm 'summer nights' feeling. I'm heading to Miami soon and want to catch some local radio while there. I've also been following that British singer-songwriter with the ginger hair who did 'Shape of You' - what's his full discography like? That song of his about love and dancing - 'Thinking Out Loud' I think? - has such an interesting structure.

    "final_answer": "# Comprehensive Music Discovery Project Results\n\n## 1) Top 5 Artists on YouTube from 2022\n\nThe MusicData API provided a comprehensive list of top YouTube artists from 2022 based on view counts. Here are the top 5:\n\n1. Bad Bunny - 10,046,995,039 views\n2. Blackpink - 4,726,453,501 views\n3. BTS - 4,719,656,705 views\n4. Karol G - 4,164,397,009 views\n5. Anuel AA - 3,626,724,216 views\n\nThe data shows Latin artists dominated YouTube in 2022, with Bad Bunny having more than double the views of the second-place artist.\n\n## 2) Information about Halsey's Album 'Manic'\n\nThe Halsey Lyric Snippets tool returned basic information about the 'Manic' album:\n\n- Album Name: Manic\n- Release Date: January 17, 2020\n- Artist: Halsey\n- Contains 15 songs (only song IDs were provided, not titles)\n\nNote: The tool provided limited information, showing only the album structure without song titles or additional details about the album's content, reception, or themes.\n\n## 3) Ed Sheeran's 'Photograph' on Spotify and SoundCloud\n\n**SoundCloud Data:**\nThe SoundCloud Scraper successfully retrieved information about \"Photograph\" by Ed Sheeran:\n- Track ID: 213950659\n- Duration: 4:19 (259,030 ms)\n- Release Date: June 20, 2014\n- Genre: Pop\n- Label: Atlantic Records UK\n- Play Count: 37,474,100\n- Like Count: 416,675\n- Album: x\n- Publisher information includes writers/composers: Ed Sheeran, Johnny McDaid, Martin Harrington, Thomas Leonard\n\n**Spotify Data:**\nThe Spotify search returned incomplete results. Instead of Ed Sheeran's \"Photograph,\" it returned information for a different track (\"In Control\" by Mahmut Orhan, Ali Arutan, and Selin). The search query may have been incorrect or the API returned unrelated results.\n\n## 4) Children's Songs about Animals\n\nThe kjoller tool was used to search for \"animal songs\" but returned an empty result with status \"OK\" and no data. This indicates either no matching content was found in the database or the search parameters were insufficient.\n\n## 5) International Radio Stations for Classical Music\n\nThe Radio World tool returned a list of 20 featured radio stations but was not specifically filtered for classical music stations. The response was also cut off, showing only partial results. The stations shown included:\n- Guldkanalen 80 tal (Sweden)\n- RTBF - Classic 21 (Belgium)\n- Radio Atl\u00e1ntida (Bolivia)\n- ArenaRadio-Dance (United Kingdom)\n\nNote: The tool did not provide a way to filter specifically for classical music stations, and the results were truncated.\n\n## 6) Popular Piano Compositions on YouTube Music\n\nThe YouTube Music API search for \"piano compositions\" returned a 500 Internal Server Error. This indicates the service was either overloaded or experiencing technical difficulties at the time of the request.\n\n## 7) Taylor Swift's 'Folklore' Album on Spotify\n\nThe Spotify Web tool successfully retrieved detailed information about Taylor Swift's \"folklore (deluxe version)\":\n- Album Type: Album\n- Total Tracks: 17\n- Release Date: August 18, 2020\n- First track: \"the 1\" (explicit, duration 3:30)\n\nThe response included album artwork URLs, track listings, and preview URLs, though the complete track list was cut off in the response.\n\n## 8) Billie Eilish's Lyrics on Genius\n\nThe Genius Song Lyrics search for Billie Eilish returned information about her song \"lovely\" (with Khalid):\n- Release Date: August 11, 2017\n- Pageviews: 4,694,516\n- Lyrics State: Complete\n\nThe search returned only the first result, which was \"lovely,\" but did not provide the actual lyrics or information about other Billie Eilish songs. The response was also cut off before showing all search results.\n\n## 9) Comparing Trending Hip-Hop Artists Across Platforms\n\nNone of the tools provided specific information about trending hip-hop artists across different platforms. The YouTube top artists list included some hip-hop artists (like Drake at #23 and Eminem at #22), but no comprehensive comparison across platforms was available from the tools used.\n\n## Summary\n\nYour music discovery project has yielded mixed results. While some queries returned comprehensive information (like YouTube's top artists and SoundCloud track details), others were incomplete (Halsey's album) or failed entirely (piano compositions search). For a complete project, you may need to supplement with additional research, especially for the children's animal songs, classical radio stations, and hip-hop artist comparisons that returned limited or no results.",

Then I wanted to dive into that emotional album Halsey released right before COVID hit - you know, the one with all the raw, personal tracks? I also stumbled across this interesting electronic track with Middle Eastern influences featuring a vocalist named Selin - I think the ID starts with '4WN'. Speaking of music, I was trying to find that iconic Ed Sheeran ballad on SoundCloud - the one with the nostalgic lyrics about photographs and memories. I'm also putting together a playlist for my niece who loves songs about animals. For my radio show, I need about 20 stations to feature on our homepage. I've been looking for some calming piano pieces on YouTube Music too - maybe 15 options would be enough to start. Oh, and I wanted to check out Taylor Swift's pandemic album - the one with all the folklore stories (ID starts with '1pzv'). Finally, I'm writing an article about Billie Eilish and need to reference about 10 of her most significant works."

    "final_answer": "# Comprehensive Music Discovery Collection\n\nI've gathered diverse music content from around the world for your international friends gathering. Here's what I found:\n\n## 1. Trending YouTube Videos from South Korea\nThe tool call for Korean YouTube trends returned no data. This appears to be a limitation of the tool execution, so we don't have current South Korean trending videos to share.\n\n## 2. Latest Billboard Independent Albums Chart\nThe Billboard Independent Albums chart from October 8, 2022 shows:\n1. \"Un Verano Sin Ti\" by Bad Bunny (21 weeks on chart)\n2. \"5SOS5\" by 5 Seconds Of Summer (new entry)\n3. \"Flawless Like Me\" by LUCKI (new entry)\n4. \"Subject To Change\" by Kelsea Ballerini (new entry)\n5. \"If I Know Me\" by Morgan Wallen (165 weeks on chart)\n6. \"Greatest Hits\" by Queen (117 weeks on chart)\n7. \"YHLQMDLG\" by Bad Bunny (135 weeks on chart)\n\nNote: The tool returned only a partial list (7 out of likely 25+ entries) and the data is from 2022, not current.\n\n## 3. Classical Piano Playlists on SoundCloud\nThe SoundCloud search for Ludovico Einaudi piano playlists with classical tag returned no data. This appears to be a limitation in the tool execution.\n\n## 4. Upcoming Concerts in the US\nThe Spotify Concerts tool returned partial data for a concert at RFK Stadium in Washington on July 15, 2023, featuring multiple artists including Lil Uzi Vert and Jazmine Sullivan. However, the data appears to be truncated and may be outdated since we're now past that date.\n\n## 5. Billboard Global Chart (Excluding US)\nThe Billboard Global Excl. US chart from May 20, 2023 shows:\n1. \"Un x100to\" by Grupo Frontera X Bad Bunny\n2. \"Cupid\" by Fifty Fifty\n3. \"La Bebe\" by Yng Lvcas x Peso Pluma\n4. \"Ella Baila Sola\" by Eslabon Armado X Peso Pluma\n5. \"Flowers\" by Miley Cyrus\n6. \"Idol\" by YOASOBI\n\nNote: The data appears to be truncated and is from May 2023, not current.\n\n## 6. Radio Stations in Jakarta, Indonesia\nThe search for radio stations in Jakarta, Indonesia returned no results. This could indicate either a limitation of the database or that the specific search parameters didn't match any available stations.\n\n## 7. Most Viewed YouTube Music Videos (21st Week of 2019)\nThe top YouTube music videos from week 21 of 2019 were:\n1. \"Con Calma\" by Daddy Yankee & Snow (42,637,249 views)\n2. \"Con Altura\" by ROSAL\u00cdA, J Balvin ft. El Guincho (35,933,384 views)\n3. \"Calma (Remix)\" by Pedro Cap\u00f3, Farruko (34,557,357 views)\n4. \"Te Robar\u00e9\" by Nicky Jam x Ozuna (30,369,080 views)\n5. \"Soltera Remix\" by Lunay X Daddy Yankee X Bad Bunny (29,584,502 views)\n6. \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X ft. Billy Ray Cyrus (29,257,954 views)\n7. \"Otro Trago\" by Sech ft. Darell (28,659,089 views)\n8. \"Bekhayali\" from Kabir Singh (28,329,358 views)\n\nNote: The data appears to be truncated and is specifically from 2019.\n\n## 8. Lyrics for 'The Saltwater Room' by Owl City\nComplete lyrics were successfully retrieved, including verses like:\n\"Time together isn't ever quite enough\nWhen you and I are alone\nI've never felt so at home\nWhat will it take to make or break this hint of love?\nOnly time, only time\"\n\n## 9. Search for 'Despacito' Across Music Platforms\nThe search returned YouTube results for \"Despacito\":\n1. \"Luis Fonsi - Despacito ft. Daddy Yankee\" (281 seconds)\n2. \"Luis Fonsi \u2012 Despacito (Lyrics / Lyric Video) ft. Daddy Yankee\" (241 seconds)\n3. Several shorts/clips related to \"Despacito\"\n\nNote: The search was limited to YouTube only, despite the tool's capability to search across multiple platforms.\n\n## 10. Continuous Radio Mix Stream\nThe Radio Dosis Mix stream returned binary data, indicating that a stream URL is available, but the actual audio content cannot be displayed in text format. This stream would need to be accessed through an audio player.\n\n## Summary\nI've compiled a diverse collection of music content, though several tools returned partial or no data. For your gathering, you have access to global music charts, popular YouTube videos from 2019, complete lyrics for \"The Saltwater Room,\" and links to \"Despacito\" content. You also have a radio stream URL for background music. To enhance this collection, you might want to manually search for Korean trends, classical piano playlists, and Jakarta radio stations using dedicated music platforms.",

I'm doing a bit of research on past music trends too, so I'd appreciate if you could pull up the most viewed YouTube music videos from the 21st week of 2019. Oh, and I need the lyrics for 'The Saltwater Room' by Owl City on SoundCloud, want to search for the song 'Despacito', and finally, I'd like to stream Radio Dosis Mix.",
    "hard_rewrite": "I'm curious about what's capturing attention in South Korea's video scene these days. After that, I'd love to see what independent artists are charting well right now. I've been in a contemplative piano mood lately - perhaps something classical by that Italian composer who does film scores? His pieces would be perfect for my upcoming cross-country journey. Speaking of which, I should check what live music events might coincide with my US travel dates. Also, I remember seeing some interesting global music trends from last May - specifically that chart that shows what's popular everywhere except America. I'll be visiting Indonesia soon and would love to tune into local broadcasts while in the capital city. Oh, and I've been wondering which music videos were making waves during that specific week in spring 2019 - the 21st week, I believe. There's also this dreamy Owl City song about an ocean room that I'd like to read along with while listening. And whatever happened to that catchy Latin song everyone was dancing to? Finally, I could use some continuous background music while I work - perhaps that mix station would be perfect."

    "query": "The user explored multiple music-related services focusing on summer 2023 music trends and specific artists. They first checked Billboard Global 200 chart rankings for June 15, 2023, then browsed Halsey's song catalog and specifically looked up lyrics for her song 'Without Me'. They accessed a Spotify radio playlist based on The Weeknd (artist ID 1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ) and searched YouTube Music for 'summer hits 2023' with a limit of 20 results. They also retrieved detailed information about an artist with YouTube channel ID 'UCqECaJ8Gagnn7YCbPEzWH6g'. On Spotify, they searched for 15 'dance pop' tracks. Finally, they performed audio manipulation by extending a YouTube video (DyDfgMOUjCI) to 30 minutes in MP3 format, concatenated three YouTube videos (0zXcC-haBFc, IgOci6JXPIc, DyDfgMOUjCI) into a single MP3 file, and retrieved a file called 'FestivalLogo2023' from the Miza server.",

Generate a Spotify radio playlist based on The Weeknd (using his Spotify URI: spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ). Search YouTube Music in English for 'summer hits 2023' with a 20-result limit. Get detailed information about Taylor Swift using her YouTube channel ID 'UCqECaJ8Gagnn7YCbPEzWH6g'. Search Spotify for 15 tracks in the 'dance pop' genre. Then perform these audio manipulations: extend the YouTube video 'DyDfgMOUjCI' to 30 minutes in MP3 format, concatenate three YouTube videos (0zXcC-haBFc, IgOci6JXPIc, and DyDfgMOUjCI) into a single MP3 file, and retrieve the file 'FestivalLogo2023' from the Miza server.",

While you're at it, would you mind pulling up a Spotify radio playlist based on The Weeknd (artist ID 1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ)? I'd like to browse through about 20 'summer hits 2023' on YouTube Music as well. There's this artist with YouTube channel ID 'UCqECaJ8Gagnn7YCbPEzWH6g' I've been curious about - could you find some detailed information on them? For my workout playlist, I need around 15 'dance pop' tracks from Spotify. Lastly, I'm working on a music project and need some audio files: could you extend that YouTube video (DyDfgMOUjCI) to 30 minutes in MP3 format, combine these three YouTube videos (0zXcC-haBFc, IgOci6JXPIc, DyDfgMOUjCI) into a single MP3 file, and retrieve the 'FestivalLogo2023' file from the Miza server?",

I'm also trying to rediscover that emotional Halsey song - the one about a relationship ending where she sings about filling someone's cup. Speaking of artists, I'm curious what The Weeknd's musical style might inspire in terms of similar sounds. I was hoping to compile a summer playlist - what were people listening to last summer? There's this YouTube channel I follow but I can't remember the artist's name - only their channel ID starts with UCqECaJ8G. For my workout sessions, I need some upbeat dance pop tracks. Oh, and I'm working on a continuous mix - that atmospheric YouTube video with ID DyDfgMOUjCI would be perfect extended to half an hour. Actually, I'm thinking of combining a few videos into one file - those three specific ones I bookmarked. Lastly, I need that festival logo graphic the server was hosting for an event promotion."

I checked the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart for May 13, 2023 (top 20 positions) and the Billboard Artist 100 chart from March 15, 2022. I viewed trending albums over the past month (15 entries) and found the top YouTube artists of 2022 including featured appearances. I also checked popular songs across all genres from the past day (20 entries). I created an MP3 version of a specific YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgOci6JXPIc), extending it to 45 minutes. I searched for information about composer Ennio Morricone, and finally extracted all songs from a YouTube playlist (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXFwTY00FRUUZzL_Vjhy-bE8WIao3eyOi).",

While you're at it, could you pull up the trending albums from the past month (about 15 entries) and show me who the top YouTube artists of 2022 were, including their featured appearances? I'm also interested in checking out about 20 popular songs across all genres from just the past day. On a specific note, I need to create an MP3 version of this YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgOci6JXPIc) and extend it to 45 minutes. Oh, and can you look up some background information on composer Ennio Morricone?

I was curious about which music videos reached a billion views the fastest, and then got interested in that K-pop group with nine members - you know, the one with the fandom called 'Once'. I also wanted to check what was trending in Japan's music charts back in mid-May last year, and who the most popular artists were according to Billboard in early 2022. I tried looking at what albums have been getting attention recently, but had some technical issues. I was fascinated to see which artists dominated YouTube last year, including their featured appearances. I wanted to check what songs were trending across genres yesterday but ran into some problems there too. There's this beautiful instrumental piece I found (that one at IgOci6JXPIc) that I wished was longer - about 45 minutes would be perfect for my meditation practice. I also wanted to learn more about that legendary Italian film composer who scored all those spaghetti westerns. Finally, I saved this interesting YouTube playlist and wanted to see all the tracks it contains."

Could you find me a selection of random radio stations from around the world? I'd also like to see what's trending on Spotify's US homepage right now. While we're looking at radio, can you pull up some channels specifically from country ID 50? I'm interested in discovering piano music too - would you mind searching for some piano artists on SoundCloud? I have a specific piano video on YouTube that I'd love to have as an MP3, but I only want the first 30 minutes of it. Also, I'm designing a music homepage and need to see some featured radio stations for inspiration. Could you specifically look up jazz radio stations as well? I'd like to create a custom music mix by combining three YouTube piano videos into a single MP3 file. Lastly, could you check out Spotify's official playlists and see what radio stations are available through the Kooed service?",
    "hard_rewrite": "I've been thinking about expanding my musical horizons lately. I wonder what radio stations exist in different corners of the world? It would be interesting to discover some completely random broadcasts from places I've never considered. Speaking of discovery, what's currently capturing people's attention on Spotify in America? I'm also curious about what radio options might be available in that country with ID 50 - I've heard they have some unique broadcasting traditions. On another note, I've been wanting to find some talented keyboard artists on SoundCloud to follow. Oh, and there's this beautiful piano piece on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VONMkKkdf4) that's quite long - I'd love to have just the first half-hour of it as an MP3 for my morning meditation. What stations would make a good showcase for a music website's homepage? And where might I find broadcasts specifically focused on those smooth saxophone improvisations? I have three favorite piano performances on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E6b3swbnWg, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNJH1rikujI, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VR-6AS0-l4) that would make a perfect continuous listening experience combined into one file. By the way, what playlists has Spotify itself curated officially? And lastly, I heard about this service called Kooed - do they offer any radio options worth exploring?"
