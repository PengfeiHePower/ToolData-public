Could you also throw in what was blowing up on YouTube around May 2019? I'm including a section on electronic music pioneers and need some background on Daft Punk's discography. Oh, and my Uzbek roommate keeps playing this one song that's apparently super popular back home right now. And what new stuff just dropped in the US that I could use to wrap things up?",

I'm planning a European road trip for March next year and want to build a playlist with similar vibes to what was popular there around early 2020 when this song was everywhere. I'm especially interested in what was trending in Spain, Luxembourg and Croatia back then, and curious about this artist's background and what else they've released over the years. Could you help me create something that captures that same energetic, night-driving feeling?",

But I want to go deeper too - what other albums did they release around that time? I'm also curious how their popularity compares to other big artists throughout history. Oh, and since my presentation ends with my current phase, could you find me some indie rock stations that might play artists similar to Halsey? I've been obsessed with her random emotional lyrics lately, especially after seeing her on the global charts. Would be cool to see who else is topping those charts right now too!",

I'm focusing on how Arctic Monkeys' sound evolved compared to what Atlantic Records UK was putting out around that time. There's this specific album I found with ID 2115888 that I think shows the connection perfectly. Also, I want to compare what's going viral globally now versus what's trending in the US charts to show how tastes differ. I'm particularly interested in what was happening in Sweden around May 2022 - I heard they had this unique sound bubbling up. Oh, and I need to include something about who the biggest artists were back in 2020 compared to the top albums of 2021. Last thing - I need to include those catchy Blackpink lyrics from 'DDU-DU DDU-DU' to show K-pop's global impact. This presentation is due tomorrow and I'm totally overwhelmed!",

I've always been fascinated by those robot-helmet guys who made that album with the funky hit from 2013 - you know, the one that was everywhere that summer? I need to understand their impact globally, like how they ranked against other artists around that time and maybe compare their popularity in places like Ireland and Hong Kong. Also, I'd love to know what their most beloved tracks are versus what's considered the greatest hits of all time. I've heard they have some medium-length remixes floating around online too. Oh, and since they're French, I should probably include how they compare to other French artists on YouTube!",

I'm also doing a special section on how Afrobeats was breaking into the US market that April. Oh, and my professor wants us to include some music history too - like what are the absolute classic summer anthems of all time? And I remember Coldplay was doing something interesting that year, so I'd like to highlight them. Also, there's this Metallica instrumental track called Orion that apparently got sampled a lot - that would be perfect for my 'musical influences' section. And weirdly, I need to include something for the kids' section of the exhibition - maybe just a simple classic like the ABC song? Last thing - my professor is really into the business side of music, so I should probably include something about which record labels were dominating in 2020 right before the pandemic changed everything.",
