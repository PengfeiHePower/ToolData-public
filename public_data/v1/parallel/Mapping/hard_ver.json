I'm particularly interested in the Mission District - specifically around Valencia Street where I've found an apartment at 1592 Valencia Street and there's a coffee shop called Ritual Coffee Roasters on Valencia St that I'd like to visit. Could you tell me which zip codes cover this area (I think 94110 and 94103 might be relevant) and what neighborhood it's officially considered? I'm also curious about the elevation there since I'll be biking. On a completely different note, I'm doing research on two global events - can you tell me about armed conflicts that were reported on February 24, 2022, and wildfire news from May 23, 2022? Finally, what area does the 95113 postal code cover in the US? Thanks for helping with all these questions!",

I'm starting from Tokyo Station (35.6812, 139.7673) and need to get to Yokohama (35.4477, 139.6478) with my delivery truck that weighs about 20 tons. Can you show me different route options, including one that avoids toll roads? Also, I'm wondering how long it would take to cycle between Shibuya (35.659, 139.7) and Akasaka (35.7056, 139.7519). On a separate note, I need information about a Canadian postal code V6B 1P1 for sending a package. I also have three US landmarks I need the coordinates for: Empire State Building, Willis Tower, and Google's headquarters. For my Berlin trip next week, I'll be staying near Brandenburg Gate (52.5251, 13.3696) - what areas can I reach within 30 minutes by car? Speaking of driving, what's the fastest way to get from the Eiffel Tower to Notre Dame in Paris, with alternative routes? How far is it to drive from Madrid to Barcelona? And finally, can you find Plaza de Catalu\u00f1a in Barcelona and recommend some food places within 5km of downtown Santiago, Chile (-33.437, -70.65)? I prefer English recommendations.",

I'm looking for pubs and bars within walking distance (about half a mile) but want to avoid gyms. Also, I'm curious about the terrain and elevation changes around here. My French-speaking friend is joining me later - is there a way to see the area map with French labels? By the way, I think there's a street called Wewatta nearby but I'm not sure of the spelling - can you confirm that? And lastly, for a data visualization project I'm working on, I need to know what hexagonal grid cell this location falls into at a high resolution.",

I'd also like to know what points of interest are within a 5km radius of that same location. Additionally, I'm researching a project on regional conflicts and need information about conflict clusters from February 24, 2022.

There's another property I'm considering at 37.5387, -77.4341 - what's the exact address? I'm also interested in finding restaurants within about a mile of Virginia Commonwealth University (around 37.5615, -77.4682). What's the broader Richmond-Petersburg media market like? And since I'm concerned about environmental factors, were there any significant wildfires reported in the region around September 2021? Finally, can you tell me the addresses for the White House and the Colosseum in Rome for comparison to my potential new home?",

I'm thinking of staying in either Arlington (zip 22201) or downtown DC (zip 20004) and want to understand the boundaries of these areas, as well as the general shape of Virginia and DC's layout. I'm also curious about the terrain around the White House area - is it hilly or flat? Could you provide some visual reference of the area's geography? Oh, and I'm particularly interested in the county that includes the National Mall - I think it might be in DC proper but I'm not sure.",

    "query": "I'm planning a trip to Tokyo Imperial Palace and would like to explore the area. Can you help me find interesting spots within 5km of the palace? Also, I'm curious about public transportation options, especially nearby train stations. While we're at it, I'd love to see different map views of this area to understand the terrain and geography. On a separate note, I'm doing research on recent global conflicts - specifically what happened when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Could you also tell me what county the White House is located in? I believe its zip code is 20500. Oh, and I'll need some font options for a presentation I'm making about all this - is Roboto Regular available for the full character range?",

Also, I'm concerned about wildfire risks since my cousin's visit on May 23, 2022 was affected by smoke. Could you show me what the wildfire situation was like on that specific date, both the actual fire locations and how the news was reporting them across the region? I'm also curious about two hexagonal grid areas I've seen on a wildfire map - 8726e36dfffffff and 87266191fffffff - how far apart are these areas and what's between them? Finally, what would the local time have been at my Boulder coordinates on January 1, 2023 at midnight UTC, and could you show me what the area looks like on a map?",

After that, I need to drive from Detroit (42.3314, -83.0458) to Buffalo (42.8864, -78.8784) and want detailed turn-by-turn directions. I'm also organizing a tour around Calgary - starting at Calgary Tower, then visiting the University of Calgary and CF Chinook Centre before returning to the tower. On a different note, I'm analyzing wildfire data from May 23, 2022 in GeoJSON format for my environmental impact study. I also need neighborhood information for Little Rock, Arkansas (34.6937, -92.3629) where we're setting up a field station. What timezone is Denver (39.7392, -104.9903) in? My colleague needs this for scheduling calls. Finally, can you show me a simple map tile at coordinates z:3, x:1, y:3 for our presentation background?",

I'd like to see maps of both areas, understand their boundaries, and get a sense of the topography. Also, what's the driving distance from St. Louis to Kansas City? I'm particularly interested in the elevation changes in St. Louis, especially downtown around the coordinates 38.6270,-90.1994 and also in the western part at 38.5260,-90.4991. Could you also show me a detailed terrain map of the area right around the Gateway Arch (roughly between 38.635 and 38.625 latitude, and -90.190 and -90.180 longitude)? Oh, and what other counties are in Missouri? I'm also considering staying in one of these zip codes: 63101, 63103, or 63104 - could you tell me about those areas too?",

I'm also curious about what zip codes are within 5 miles of Columbus Circle, and since I'm putting together a demographic report for a marketing project in New York state, could you include information about the DMA regions there? Also, I'd like to see what the terrain looks like in that area - is there a way to get a detailed hillshade map view?",

Then I want to visit three places: the area near Oracle Park, Potrero Hill, and back to Fisherman's Wharf - but I want the most efficient route between these stops. I'm also considering biking from Fisherman's Wharf to the Golden Gate Bridge area. Could you tell me what census tract and zip code Fisherman's Wharf is in? Also, I'd like to know what hospitals and clinics are available in the central San Francisco area. On a different note, I'm concerned about any recent wildfires in the region as of today, and I'm researching historical armed conflicts from when the Ukraine war began. Finally, I'd like to see a map tile of the area and get a dark-themed map style for my navigation app.",

    "query": "I'm planning a visit to Lower Manhattan next month and I'm particularly interested in the area around Battery Park City. Could you show me a detailed map of that area around 40.71, -74.005? I'd also like to know about the elevation changes along the waterfront between there and nearby Pier 11. Also, what kinds of street objects and imagery are available in that neighborhood? I'm curious about who's been documenting the area with photos. While we're at it, can you tell me what restaurants and convenience stores are within walking distance (about 500 meters)? Oh, and since I'm a history buff, I'd like to know the official county boundary details for New York County in NY state. Lastly, my friend mentioned something about analyzing conflict clusters from the beginning of the Ukraine war (February 24, 2022) - could you pull up that information too?",

I'm also curious about the different neighborhoods in Texas, particularly in Travis County. What are the various zip codes in the county and their boundaries? Also, what points of interest are within about 2km of the city center (around -97.7431, 30.2672)?

Could you help me understand the street-level imagery changes that have happened recently in the area bounded roughly by the National Mall and Navy Yard (around -77.02 to -76.99 longitude and 38.88 to 38.90 latitude)? I'm particularly interested in pending location changes or deletions. Also, I need census tract information for DC county, and detailed boundary information for the 20003 zip code. Additionally, I'm studying how this area relates to global armed conflicts as of February 24, 2022. There's a specific landmark with ID R457891 that I need detailed information about in English. Finally, could you provide me with some map tiles at zoom level 12 (coordinates x:1207, y:1540) in both standard OSM style and the 'osm-bright' style for my presentation?",

What's the elevation at the Austin Capitol building (30.2672, -97.7431), and can you tell me which state and county this is in? I'm also curious about all counties in Texas and the boundaries of downtown Austin zip codes like 78701, 78704, and 78751. For comparison, I'm looking at urban development in Japan too - what cities are there? Also, I'm analyzing environmental impacts and need data on wildfires from August 15, 2022.

Additionally, can you show me the terrain elevation between 34.04,-118.26 and 34.06,-118.24? I'm also interested in exploring street-level imagery from sequence AFpB1_2Y05u584p-1Z8Jkg, and finding the official city boundaries of Los Angeles.

    "query": "I'm planning a hiking trip in San Francisco near the Presidio area tomorrow and I'm concerned about safety. Can you tell me about the terrain elevation changes between the Marina district (around 37.7985, -122.4637) and Baker Beach (roughly 37.805, -122.47)? Also, what interesting places are near the Marina district that aren't gyms? I need to know the current local time there since I'm traveling from overseas. Could you show me a map of the area? I'm also worried about potential wildfires and any conflicts happening in California right now that might affect my trip. What are the road conditions like within a kilometer of the Marina district? Finally, what county is this area in, and what are the major media market regions in California I should monitor for local news?",
